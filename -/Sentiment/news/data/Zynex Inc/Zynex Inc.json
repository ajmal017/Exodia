View our latest analysis for Zynex  View our latest analysis for Zynex Or for Zynex:Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Zynex has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Medical Equipment industry.That is a good sign. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.That is a good sign. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.Shareholders will be pleased to learn that Zynex has not one iota of net debt! Its high ROE already points to a high quality business, but the lack of debt is a cherry on top. After all, when a company has a strong balance sheet, it can often find ways to invest in growth, even if it takes some time.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

We thought readers would find it interesting to see analysts' latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. View our latest analysis for Zynex  View our latest analysis for Zynex After the latest results, the three analysts covering Zynex are now predicting revenues of US$75.8m in 2020. If met, this would reflect a sizeable 67% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to expand 20% to US$0.35. Yet prior to the latest earnings, analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$59.9m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.34 in 2020. Analyst definitely think the business is capable of improving its revenues, even if they don't foresee any real change in earnings per share.The consensus price target increased 59% to US$19.08, with an improved revenue forecast carrying the promise of a more valuable business, in time. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Zynex at US$21.75 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$15.00. This shows there is still quite a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.Further, we can compare these estimates to past performance, and see how Zynex forecasts compare to the wider market's forecast performance. It's clear from the latest estimates that Zynex's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with forecast 67% revenue growth noticeably faster than its historical growth of 32%p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.7% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, analysts also expect Zynex to grow faster than the wider market.With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Zynex. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

But EPS is up 410% over the last 3 years.The extra options and safety that comes with Zynex's US$14m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.Zynex trades on a P/E ratio of 44.4, which is multiples above its market average of 14.0. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: and the high P/E suggests the market thinks it will. What we know for sure is that investors have become much more excited about Zynex recently, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 34.1 to 44.4 over the last month.

See our latest analysis for Zynex  See our latest analysis for Zynex We can tell from its P/E ratio of 54.65 that there is some investor optimism about Zynex. The image below shows that Zynex has a higher P/E than the average (45.1) P/E for companies in the medical equipment industry.Its relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Zynex shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should delve deeper.

Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.Zynex's earnings per share were pretty steady over the last year. But EPS is up 410% over the last 3 years.The extra options and safety that comes with Zynex's US$14m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.Zynex's P/E is 54.6 which suggests the market is more focussed on the future opportunity rather than the current level of earnings. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. Clearly, the high P/E indicates shareholders think it will! What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about Zynex over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 35.2 back then to 54.6 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But the contrarian may see it as a missed opportunity.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.

The Colorado-based medical technology company specializes in manufacturing and selling noninvasive devices for pain management, stroke rehabilitation, neurological diagnostics, and cardiac monitoring.Yes, you read that last sentence correctly. Despite all the turmoil in the market this year, Zynex's share price has skyrocketed, with a 122% rise in the past three months alone. The question is: Can it continue?\u00a0\u00a0Zynex, which was founded in 1996 by CEO Thomas Sandgaard, has had 15 consecutive profitable quarters. In the first quarter of 2020, it reported net revenue of $15.2 million -- a 66% increase over the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $2.9 million, up 24.9% year over year.Many of Zynex's products are designed for long-term use, which partly explains why the company hasn't been affected by supply disruptions the way other companies have. March orders were down 14% and April orders were down 35% compared with January and February averages.\"This minor temporary decline in orders speaks volumes [about] the relationships our sales force has with many prescribers and the need for them to prescribe non-opioid, nonaddictive, prescription-strength solutions for the patients in pain,\" CEO Sandgaard said in Zynex's first-quarter earnings call. The second warning sign is that the company's income comes primarily from being reimbursed by insurance companies, so any change in reimbursement policies can negatively affect the company. TRICARE, the healthcare program of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System, recently announced that on June 1, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) units and the supplies to support the devices will no longer be covered for acute, subacute, and chronic lower back pain. That includes Zynex's NexWave TENS device. 10 stocks we like better than Zynex, Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
