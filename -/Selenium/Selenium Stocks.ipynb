I\\\\'ll briefly list the points here. Manage your risk and GL!\\\\n1. He said he believes $LK now has a 50% chance to survive. The probability of delisting is HIGH, but this process is going to take time.\\\\n2. $LK aggressively cut/suspended many of its business expansion plans to survive.\\\\n3. After the scam, COO and CEO got fired. New assigned CEO passed the investigation( means he has nothing to do with the fraud)\\\\n4. $LK now has about $1.27 billion in cash, sufficient for it to survive for another two years. BUT it likely faces an $11.2 billion claim. That will crash the company.\",\n",

I\\\\'ll briefly list the points here. Manage your risk and GL!\\\\n1. He said he believes $LK now has a 50% chance to survive. The probability of delisting is HIGH, but this process is going to take time.\\\\n2. $LK aggressively cut/suspended many of its business expansion plans to survive.\\\\n3. After the scam, COO and CEO got fired. New assigned CEO passed the investigation( means he has nothing to do with the fraud)\\\\n4. $LK now has about $1.27 billion in cash, sufficient for it to survive for another two years. BUT it likely faces an $11.2 billion claim. That will crash the company.\",\n",
