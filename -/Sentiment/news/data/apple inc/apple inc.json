Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Apple patents granted in the final moments of 2019 shine a little light into its plans for the next decade.Apple won 31 patents on Dec. 31, 2019. Three are of particular interest:In some ways, these patents don\u2019t mean too much. Apple files many hundreds of patents every year and the existence of them doesn\u2019t always mean the company will ship products based on them.One way in which they matter is that they serve to prove Apple continues to invest in the development of cars, smart wearables and the long-anticipated Apple Glasses.It is a trifecta of solutions that illuminate Apple\u2019s goals for the coming decade:Apple is obviously planning for the next decade.\u00a0With 5G services and devices set to proliferate by around 2023, you can anticipate Apple\u2019s existing media and gaming services will morph into an immersive AR/VR gaming offer \u2013 while FaceTime becomes a viable solution for secure enterprise chat.Think connected devices and most people think of smart home devices.\u00a0Apple will appear at the annual trade event CES in an official capacity for the first time I can recall. The company\u2019s Jane Horvath is\u00a0scheduled to appear at a consumer privacy panel\u00a0on Jan. 7. It is being reported that Apple will also demonstrate its own smart home system, HomeKit, at the event.Apple announced participation in an important open source partnership\u00a0to improve the compatibility of the many disparate smart device systems in conjunction with Amazon, Google and others in 2019.\u201cBy building upon Internet Protocol (IP), the project aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification,\u201dthe partners\u00a0said.Apple has understood this\u00a0for longer than any of them.As devices themselves become more intelligent, the information they gather also becomes more sophisticated.\u00a0Ultimately it's easy to predict smart devices that work in clusters to provide actionable intelligent insights to your homes, workplaces and factories.Apple will begin its move to 5G with the release of new iPhones in 2020.\u00a0Don\u2019t expect too much from 5G yet \u2013 most people won\u2019t see stable and reliable 5G connections until 2022-23, and service deployments will be hybrid (5G/4G) for longer than that. This ZeroHedge report explains some of the reasons for this.The thing is, Apple (like most in the tech landscape) has come to realize that connectivity and bandwidth are absolutely essential to all the solutions it now seeks to make.\u00a0(This is probably why the company continues experimenting with a satellite-based networking system.)And this also means one of the most important components of Apple\u2019s plans for the new decade will be successful proliferation of 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and other networking standards (including the aforementioned IP-based standard for smart devices).Which is why we should watch how Apple evidences its move to 5G within iPhones \u2013 and pay attention to its various IP development partnerships (such as with Intel and Ericsson) as it seeks to deploy its own self-developed 5G networking chips.The latter will be of particular importance, as these systems will become the networking brains inside any future Apple vehicles (or immersive AR/VR devices) \u2013 and will need to work well with any other smart vehicles that may also be on the road.Please follow me on\u00a0Twitter, or join me in the\u00a0AppleHolic\u2019s bar & grill\u00a0and\u00a0Apple Discussions\u00a0groups on MeWe.Jonny is a freelance writer who has been writing (mainly about Apple and technology) since 1999.", "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has landed former HBO chief Richard Plepler, a respected entertainment industry executive, to make TV shows and movies for its new Apple TV+ streaming service.(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has landed former HBO chief Richard Plepler, a respected entertainment industry executive, to make TV shows and movies for its new Apple TV+ streaming service.Plepler and his new company, Eden Productions, will develop original programs exclusively for TV+, the Cupertino, California-based company said Thursday.

Economic Daily isn't sure. Regardless, the site concluded that Apple will reveal the device at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June 2020. \u00a0If it wasn't obvious by now, we're pretty dubious of these claims. Apple hasn't put much stake in gaming, apart from its mobile gaming subscription service: Apple Arcade. The problem with Apple wanting to compete in the gaming space is that macOS' gaming ecosystem lags far behind Windows 10's. \u00a0If Apple can create compelling hardware it might encourage developers to spend time making a macOS version of their games.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo announced in March that a MacBook with an ARM processor might be launched in late 2020 or early 2021.Bloomberg published a report in late April that Apple will use a 12-core ARM processor based on the 5nm process for the ARM MacBook. The chip will contain eight high-performance cores, codenamed \u2018Firestorm\u2019. This will be paired with four energy-efficient \u2018Icestorm\u2019 cores. The processor will be based on the design of the A14 chip. As you know, it will appear on the upcoming iPhone 12.Bloomberg\u2019s report pointed out the desktop version of the A14 processor will also integrate both CPU and GPU. In fact, Apple started to develop a desktop version of the ARM processor project a few years ago. This project is called Kalamata. Of course, many may think this is senseless. But with this move, Apple hopes to get rid of its dependence on Intel on the desktop platform. On the other hand, it also hopes to integrate its own hardware and software ecosystem. So the mobile version and desktop version of the software and hardware can be updated simultaneously.In addition to Apple\u2019s desktop version of the A-series processors, Qualcomm and Microsoft have been also preparing related products in recent years. Microsoft has launched its own Surface Pro X. Next, we will see more laptops equipped with ARM processors, which will also affect Intel\u2019s market share.Though we began paying attention to the news about the ARM-based Mac series products, the rumors about Apple\u2019s own desktop chips based on this architecture take us to 2012.

According to a leaker, these modifications won't include a change to the display. \rIn a tweet on Sunday, leaker @L0vetodream offered the typically brief statement \"the Apple Watch S6 will continue to use the display from JDI.\" This is in reference to the Series 5's OLED displays supplied by Japan Display Inc, a firm within Apple's supply chain that reportedly received a $936 million financial bailout in January 2020, followed by a further $200 million from a customer believed to be Apple. \rin my dream the Apple Watch S6 will continue use the display from JDIThe twitter account is generally thought to be offering genuine leaks on Apple products, and has made a number of pronouncements about a variety of products, including the iPad Pro LiDAR sensor and a game controller. \rIf true, the tweet means that potential \"Apple Watch Series 6\" buyers won't be seeing a new display in the model, and it is likely to be similar in size and specification to the Series 5. Updated in 2019, the Series 5 uses an alway-on LTPO OLED Retina display, allowing for the screen to be viewable without needing a gesture or tap to turn it on. \rRumors over the years put forward the idea that Apple would employ newer display technologies in the Apple Watch, with a frontrunner being micro LED. Reports from 2018 suggested Apple was exploring commencing mass production of display panels using MicroLED, while the 2020 Apple Watch model was thought to be one of the initial devices from Apple to use the technology. \rEarlier in May, reports indicated Apple is planning to invest $330 million in a factory in Taiwan for the production of mini LED and micro LED panels.

One question has never been answered when Apple stores are robbed is whether the products looted (specifically iOS products) can be used by the thieves. I have never seen a for-sure answer.

Shares of Apple were trading near their 52-week high on Monday. It\u2019s up 9.3% year to date, compared with the S&P 500 (down 5.46%).According to analysts, the Apple price target is $301.68. Last week, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan raised his target to $340. He noted that Apple\u2019s large user base for both phones and computers should continue to drive sales of services and accessories.Steve Jobs made his mark of course with the Apple computer, a revolutionary product introduced in 1976 as a kit (the Apple I) that forever changed personal computing. But over time, desktops and laptops have become a smaller part of the company\u2019s portfolio.The big seller now of course is the iPhone, which Jobs introduced in 2007, a few years after the iPod music device. The iPad tablets came on the scene in 2010, and the first Apple Watch made its debut in 2015 under Tim Cook\u2019s leadership. And Apple services businesses (including apps, music and streaming video) account for a growing share of revenues.But in the United States, most households still use a desktop or laptop. Apple sells premium products in this space, which are attractive to families with more disposable income.\u201cTo make a better laptop than this Apple will have to radically redesign the machine, so this feels like the last great version of a long-running model,\u201d said a reviewer in The Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not exciting, nor does it reinvent the wheel but it is great -\u2013 the 13-inch MacBook Pro many have been waiting for.\u201dThe new Mac replaces Apple\u2019s old Butterfly keyboard design with the new Magic design. Critics said the old design was prone to malfunctions, and Apple has been phasing it out.It will be interesting to see how the new laptop sells in the current environment. Starting at $1,299, the Macbook Pro sits in the middle of Apple\u2019s laptop product set. Best Buy is currently offering the entry-level model even cheaper, at $1,099.Apple\u2019s desktops range in price from $1,099 to $5,999 and up.If unemployment remains high, analysts expect consumers to postpone major purchases, including computers. Those who do shop may be drawn to cheaper alternatives, such as Chromebooks, machines running the Chrome operating system from Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Those devices are typically cheaper than Apple machines and many PCs that use the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) operating system.The tech press dinged Apple on Monday for doubling the price of RAM upgrades for the entry-level model. The MacRumors publication discovered that the cost of upgrading the new 13-inch Macbook Pro from 8GB to 16GB of memory went from $100 to $200. In Europe, the upgrade jumped from \u20ac125 to \u20ac250.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely rare for Apple to adjust pricing so soon after launch, suggesting an unexpected increase in Apple\u2019s costs being passed along to consumers,\u201d according to MacRumors.", "Amazon-owned grocery chain Whole Foods Market has also reportedly closed locations, according to CNBC.

There are fans of the process, but Apple argues that its ecosystem provides customers with higher levels of security compared with Android, which allows customization and the installation of apps from alternative app stores.Along with the iOS and iPad release, Apple also released an updated version for other devices with macOS 10.15.5, watchOS 6.2.6, tvOS 13.4.6 and HomePod 13.4.6.In the case of the watchOS update, it would appear that Apple may have patched the same vulnerability that was found in iOS.\u00a0The update to macOS is described as a supplemental update that provides an identical description to that of the iOS update despite macOS and iOS being different software.Forgot Password?", "Apple Inc.

These new features described are based on an early build of iOS 14 obtained by 9to5Mac.Siri on iOS can already translate words and phrases, and Apple might now expand this translation feature throughout the system. 9to5Mac has found that Safari will have a built-in translator, allowing users to translate web pages without any third-party app or service.But Safari is just the beginning before Apple expands this feature across the system, as we found out that the translation option is also being tested with other apps, such as the App Store. In this case, iOS would translate app descriptions and reviews from users if these were written in another language.Furthermore, all the translations would be processed locally with the Neural Engine, so this feature is expected to work even without an internet connection, and it wouldn\u2019t send data to Apple. Even Siri translations are supposed to use the Neural Engine in the future, which is a big step forward since it would be possible to ask Siri to translate something if you\u2019re offline.9to5Mac has also learned that iPadOS 14 might include full support for Apple Pencil input on websites, making it compatible not only to scroll and touch but also to draw and markup with all its capabilities in Safari and other browsers.Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:Filipe Esp\u00f3sito is a Brazilian tech Journalist who started covering Apple news on iHelp BR with some exclusive scoops \u2014 including the reveal of the new Apple Watch Series 5 models in titanium and ceramic.

In this particular report we cover Apple's invention for creating synthetic group selfies which could turn out to be a lot of fun.\u00a0Apple notes that selfies are a popular way to capture or memorialize an event or moment. An individual selfie can, for example, be an image captured by a user of an image capturing device where the subject captured in the image is the user. When a user wishes to memorialize an event with friends, the user can capture a group selfie where the self-image includes the user and the user's friends. While capturing an individual selfie can be accomplished easily since only the user needs to be placed within the field of view of the image capturing device, capturing a group selfie can be much more difficult since the user must arrange the user and the user's friends within the field of view of the image capture device when capturing the group selfie.Apple's granted patent covers a computing device that can generate a synthetic group selfie. For example, a synthetic group selfie can be an arrangement or composition of individual selfies obtained from a plurality of computing devices into a single group image (e.g., synthetic group selfie). The individual selfie images can be still images, stored video images, or live streaming images.Apple's patent FIG. 1 below is a block diagram of an example system for generating synthetic group selfies; FIG. 3A illustrates a graphical user interface for generating a synthetic group selfie; FIG. 3B illustrates an example graphical user interface presenting an option to recapture an image; FIG. 4 illustrates an example graphical user interface prompting a contributor user to participate in a synthetic group selfie.Apple's patent FIG. 6 above illustrates an example graphical user interface presenting an option to recapture an image; FIG. 7 illustrates an example graphical user interface for presenting a preview of a synthetic group selfie.Apple's patent FIG. 8 below is a diagram illustrating an example synthetic group selfie composition technique; FIG. 9 illustrates an example graphical user interface for editing a synthetic group selfie; FIG. 10 illustrates an example graphical user interface for storing a synthetic group selfie.Apple's patent FIG. 11 below is flow diagram of an example process for generating synthetic group selfies; FIG. 12 is a flow diagram of an example process for participating in a synthetic group selfie at a contributor device; FIG. 13 is a flow diagram of an example process for automatically arranging individual selfies into a synthetic group selfie.Apple's granted patent was originally filed in Q3 2018 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.

Iconic musical guests include Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, Kanye West, and Hayley Williams.\u00a0\u00a0This latest offering is the first time Apple has focused solely on the entertainment industry for its original programming, and comes just as Lady Gaga prepares to release her sixth studio album, Chromatica. The series of podcasts will allow artists to talk \"about their lives and the stories behind their songs,\" where \"the biggest stars open up in these candid, in-depth conversations.\"\u00a0About 37% of U.S. adults listen to podcasts each month, according to Edison Research, giving Apple a vested interest in the space.\u00a0Apple has long been the No. 1 platform for podcast consumption, running the table for the past 15 years.

Over the past year, the stock is up more than 80% as investors have applauded the company's continual evolution to a business model that is less dependent on hardware revenue and is more services-based.But one analyst thinks the stock can continue to climb higher over the next four years -- so much so that the company's market capitalization would rise from about $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion. On the surface, this might seem like an outlandish forecast. But a closer look at Apple stock reveals that a $2 trillion market cap in four years may not only be possible but even likely.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.Since surpassing a $1 trillion market cap in 2019, shares of Apple have continued to climb sharply. Today, the tech giant is already valued at about $1.4 trillion. But Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani thinks that shares will rise about another 70% over the next four years to $550. This would give the company a $2 trillion valuation.Further robust growth in Apple's services and wearables businesses and strong operational tailwinds over the next for years will help the tech company achieve this, says Daryanani.\u00a0More sharp growth in Apple's services segment is key to Daryanani's optimistic outlook for Apple. In a recent note to investors, Daryanani said he believes Apple's services business' annual revenue could rise from about $46 billion in fiscal 2019 to $100 billion by fiscal 2024. More importantly, he believes the segment's contribution to gross profit could rise from about 30% of total gross profit today to 45% of total gross profit in fiscal 2024. The launch of new services and improvement in average revenue per user will help this high-margin, recurring-revenue business grow, Daryanani predicts.For Apple stock to appreciate enough within four years for the tech company's market cap to hit $2 trillion, shares would have to rise at an average rate of 14% over the four years. Given Apple's conservative valuation today and its momentum in both services and wearables, it's fairly easy to imagine the company's stock price appreciating this much.Today, Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 25. For a market leader with a 38% gross profit margin, net cash of $83 billion on its balance sheet, annual free cash flow of $66 billion,\u00a0and more significant potential upside for both the company's services and wearables businesses, the stock's valuation today is not only fair -- but possibly even a great buying opportunity.A $2 trillion market cap for Apple in four years wouldn't be surprising.", "Apple users have reports a host of issues today, including the Apple servers being down, iTunes not working, their Apple IDs not working, and \u201capplication does not exist\u201d errors.

In 2018, GPU as an accelerator dominated the artificial intelligence chipmarket among other chipset types. Several tech giants, including Apple Inc.; Arm Limited; Advanced Micro Devices, Inc; Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.; and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., have built their artificial intelligence chipset designs on GPUs incorporated with core CPUs. However, GPU alone is also used to boost the computing speed and performance of the chipsets, but major companies are using GPU as the main processor and CPU as an auxiliary processor while building an artificial intelligence chipset. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation offers both integrated modules of CPU and GPU and only GPUs for training and inference workload domains, namely DGX and Jetson AGX, respectively. ASIC is also contributing significantly to the growth of the artificial intelligence chipset market and used for high-performance processors. For instance, Google has built its Edge TPU and Cloud TPU based on ASIC architecture. Amazon is working on building an ASIC-based artificial intelligence chipset in order to power its Alexa home assistant. FPGA is also one of the major accelerator types as it is adopted for the development of artificial intelligence chipset by key companies, including Intel Corporation; Baidu, Inc.; and Xilinx Inc. There are several other accelerator types, such as Intelligent Processing Unit (IPU), Neural Network Processors (NNP), Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), Neural processing Unit (NPU), and Radio Processing Unit (RPU). These accelerator types are also used by some of the tech companies. Workload Domain Insights The workload domain segment is bifurcated into training and inference. The training segment holds a significant share. Several tech giants in the year 2018, such as NVIDIA Corporation; Intel Corporation; Xilinx Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.; and Google Inc. worked on developing training chipsets. However, the inference chipset market is operated by more than 40 tech firms, including at least 20 startups, and is anticipated to be the promising chipset over the forecast period owing to the growing need for edge computing due to privacy and safety concerns. As of now, most of the training is done at the cloud/data center, while inference is done both in the cloud and at the edge. The application domains for training are several Google enables applications, such as maps, organizational datasets; and for inference are autonomous vehicles, surveillance cameras, mobile devices, drones, and intelligent machines. The training chipsets market is highly dominated by the GPU segment of NVIDIA Corporation, possessing massively parallel architectures. Thus, the training workload holds significant shares in the market for AI chipset. However, several major players are inclining towards the edge from the cloud, which demonstrates a healthy growth in the inference workload domain. For instance, various large companies in the market, namely Google Inc.; Apple Inc.; Baidu Inc.; Samsung; and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., have built their artificial intelligence chipset for inference workload, supporting the computing process at the edge.

Maestri, in November 2017, stated in a press release that \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s year-over-year revenue growth rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter and drove EPS growth of 24 percent in the September quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The plaintiffs allege the statements were false and misleading because higher iPhone demand in 2017 and early 2018 was driven by artificially accelerated upgrade rates as a result of Apple intentionally throttling older-model iPhones during 2017. In December 2017, an independent report revealed that Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software updates were causing the slowdown of older iPhones, and that unexpected shutdowns were caused by aging batteries. Shortly after, Apple admitted it deliberately throttled older model iPhones to save on battery life and avoid unexpected shutdowns, the court said. To contain the public fallout from the throttling revelations, Apple offered to replace iPhone batteries at the discounted price of $29 throughout 2018.The company continued to talk up financial results until January 2, 2019, when Cook sent a letter to investors informing them that revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was expected to drop, citing the battery replacement program, as well as emerging market issues in China, the court said. The letter caused Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock market to decrease by approximately 10%, the court said. The case is In re Apple Inc. Sec. Litig., 2020 BL 205056, N.D.

It\u2019s important to note the lawsuit is filed on behalf of Escobar, the individual, and not Escobar Inc., the company.\u00a0Escobar, who has previously dealt with attempts on his life, stipulates Apple\u2018s marketing claims that the device \u201cwill never be\u201d vulnerable to attacks ultimately influenced his decision to purchase an iPhone X.For his trouble, the brother of the infamous Medellin narcotics baron is suing Apple for a \u201cBreach of Contract,\u201d \u201cNegligence/Negligence Misrepresentation,\u201d and \u201cNegligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.\u201d He\u2019s also seeking compensation of $2.6 billion.Gustafsson remains confident Apple\u2018s extension request is a positive sign for Escobar.We\u2019ve reached out to Apple and its legal representative for further comment, and will update this piece accordingly if we hear back.", "TITUSVILLE, Fla., June 03, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Apple Rush Company, Inc.

It read, \"New Apple Pencil is Black.\" This means that the new generation of the gadget may be available in the black color option. Twitter user @laobaiTD is an avid Apple hardware collector.What do we know so far? There is no confirmation or official news on a potential refresh on the design and color of Apple Pencil. The last update into this stylus happened a few years back, particularly in 2018, with the overhaul of iPad Pro. The latter was launched in 2015.Right now, the only available color of Apple Pencil is white.READ ALSO:\u00a0PSA: Apple Has a Warning to All Their Looters, You're Being Tracked!\u00a0Fan reactions are mixed with this claim.

I'm currently still using the first gen white Apple pencil with my 10.5 Pro, and everything is still working great and as smooth as can be.\"Another avid fan named @DAalseth on the forum liked the idea, suggesting that grey would be another great color. This fan also said the Apple Pencil in matte finish is also a good option.@Chasm, meanwhile reacted badly, saying, \"This one seems unlikely. As with Ear/AirPods, Apple has chosen to go with a distinctive look that immediately tells everyone you're using an Apple product (even if in fact you are using a crappy Chinese knockoff, the impression is still the same). While I would personally prefer a space-grey/black Apple Pencil 2 (3?), it would then look pretty much like every other stylus out there, so I can't see them doing that.\"The\u00a0Apple Pencil\u00a0belongs to a series of wireless stylus pen from Apple, Inc., functioning in iPad tablets. The first batch of these pens were launched on September 9, 2015.There is also no confirmation yet on whether there is a third-generation Apple Pencil launching. However, the iPad Pro lineup enabled an update in March 2020. Plus, Apple might also be developing smaller LED variants of its tablets, leading to the speculation that new stylus pens are coming through. However, the launch date may still be far-fetched, estimated in 2021.With the wide gap from the last batch of Apple Pencil launched in the market, it is highly likely that a new generation might come out soon. The controversial Twitter user is based in Singapore in their profile, and the account has a collection of Apple hardware prototypes with testing samples and validation.The official website stated, \"Apple Pencil sets the standard for how drawing, note\u2011taking, and marking up documents should feel - intuitive, precise, and magical.

Apple stock fell 10% the next day, erasing $74 billion of market value.By mid-November 2018, Apple had told the manufacturers Foxconn and Pagatron to halt plans for new iPhone production lines, and a key supplier had been told to materially reduce shipments, the complaint said.The case is In re Apple Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-02033.The case is In re Apple Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-02033.Apple Inc.Apple Inc.", "The Organic Thin Film Transistor market report covers major market players like Sharp Corporation, Sony Corporation, Apple, Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Samsung Group, LG Electronics, Fujitsu Limited, AU Optronics Corp, BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd., Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Ltd.,  ", "Data from Sensor Tower points to Apple Inc.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Analysts expect the company to release a range of 5G iPhone models later this year, but the Nikkei Asian Review reported in March that Apple was considering delaying the launch due to product development disruptions and the economic turmoil caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

While many bears continue to call for a crash and break of the March lows due to a deteriorating economic outlook, the market seems to have a different plan, as it reclaimed its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in the past two weeks. Thus far, we\u2019ve seen almost zero distribution on the way up off the March lows, suggesting institutions are buying and holding, and not doing any material selling on the way up. This improved technical picture bodes well for several tech stocks, but two names stand out in the space, one with hyper-growth in a niche area, and the other trading at a very reasonable valuation with the majority of investors flocking to the high-growth names. These two names are Five9 Inc (FIVN), and Apple (AAPL),\u00a0and we\u2019ll below discuss what makes them attractive ideas to buy on the dip below:Moving over to Apple, the stock needs no introduction, but the earnings trend above is worth highlighting. Apple has seen earnings more than double since FY-2013, despite being a mega-cap company, which highlights the company\u2019s ability to continue innovating in each new cycle and staying relevant despite a sea of competition trying to steal market share. The latest example of this is Apple TV, which could be another driver to the company\u2019s Services business. The most recent case before the push towards TV was AirPods, which have become a household item as many grew tired of untangling cords daily, and were willing to pay up to delete this nuisance from their daily tasks. As we can see from the company\u2019s earnings trends, Apple saw flat earnings in FY-2019, as it reported $11.89 in EPS vs. $11.91, but earnings are expected to accelerate in FY-2021 and FY-2022 based on estimates, with forecasts sitting at $14.81 and $16.45. Assuming Apple hits these estimates, this would translate to a 20% growth year-over-year, an incredible earnings growth rate for a trillion-dollar company.While Apple is not cheap here as we\u2019ve seen a significant rally off of its March lows, it would begin to get very interesting if we could see the stock pullback by 15% or more and head down closer to 4.5x sales. As we can see in the chart above, 4.3x \u2013 4.5x sales used to be resistance for Apple, and it looks like this level has now become new support. This shift is likely due to the company\u2019s Services business, which continues to gain traction. Therefore, while I wouldn\u2019t chase Apple at $320.00, I believe that any dips to the $285.00 level would provide buying opportunities and a lower-risk entry for the stock.While many names have seen parabolic rallies since the March lows, and investors are now flocking to the most vulnerable sectors to generate alpha, Airlines, and Cruises, I believe investors should stick to the leaders, but look to buy them on dips. Apple and Five9 are both leaders in their industries and are likely to be much higher in 12 months, but the key is buying the dip on these names, not being tempted to chase them at current levels. I believe the $85.00 level would represent a low-risk area to start a position in FIVN, and the $285.00 level on AAPL would also present a low-risk entry point. While chasing the stocks could work, I believe the noted buy zones bake in more of a margin of safety. For now, I see FIVN as a Hold.", "Opposing attorneys in a criminal case against a former in-house attorney at Apple Inc. accused of insider trading have been arguing whether it is constitutional to charge someone with insider trading.Opposing attorneys in a criminal case against a former in-house attorney at Apple Inc. accused of insider trading have been arguing whether it is constitutional to charge someone with insider trading.In February 2019, Gene Levoff was\u00a0charged\u00a0with securities fraud and wire fraud in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Specifically, the U.S. Justice Department claims that Levoff sold stock he owned in the company during blackout periods. The alleged scheme, according to prosecutors, allowed Levoff to make $27,000 on some trades and avoid losses of approximately $377,000 on others because of insider information he obtained while working at the company. Levoff was charged with six counts of wire fraud and six counts of securities fraud.In April, Levoff\u2019s attorney, Kevin Marino, founding partner at Marino, Tortorella & Boyle in Chatham, New Jersey, moved to dismiss the charges arguing that insider trading has never been made into law by Congress. He said the definition of insider trading has been created by judges and the prosecution of insider trading is unconstitutional.", "In late January Patently Apple posted a report titled \"Apple Invention Details a Prescription Lens System for a Future Head-Mounted Display Device.\" We noted in the report that \"The patent relates to a future mixed reality headset that will allow those with prescription glasses to put their unique lenses into a headset to eliminate the need to wear exterior glasses in the headset making it bulkier and less comfortable.\" Today an Apple patent takes their vision to the next level in much greater detail. \u00a0Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published two patent application from Apple that are focused on Apple's future eyeware in both Head Mounted Devices (HMD) and glasses. The main patent covers a powerful new vision correction optical system that's able to incorporate a user's glasses prescription into the system. The system will then alter the optics to address vision issues such astigmatism, farsightedness, and nearsightedness so that those who wear glasses won't have to them when using Apple's HMD.That could be a killer application for Apple because according to (an undated report by) GlassesCrafter, The Vision Council of America claims that approximately 75% of adults use some sort of vision correction.Jumping right in, Apple's patent FIG. 1 below is a diagram of a basic overview of an illustrative head-mounted device (HMD); FIG. 2 is a basic overview diagram of an illustrative head mounted device with adjustable displays and lenses. Apple notes that input-output devices (shown as #44 of FIG. 1) may include a sensing system that measures the eye characteristics of the user's eyes (#46 above). For example, a wavefront sensor such as a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, Tscherning sensor, or a ray tracing sensor may be used to measure refractive errors in a user's eyes such as astigmatism, farsightedness, and nearsightedness.The heart of Apple's corrective vision system begins with patent FIG. 4 below which presents a graph showing how the focal length of a tunable cylindrical lens can be adjusted.Beyond the basics, Apple notes that to tune the lens, another smoothly varying voltage profile (e.g., with a larger magnitude) may be applied to the liquid crystal material, thereby creating refractive index profile #68.Apple further notes that a user of the headset may not have perfect vision. For example, a user may be nearsighted, may be farsighted, and/or may have astigmatism. Further in to Apple's patent filing they note: \"For example, a user playing a video game may be in a confined space and close to surrounding objects. To allow the user's eyes to relax during the operations of (block 116 not shown), a distant mountain scene may be inserted into the video game, thereby avoiding the need to interrupt the user with a text message (\"relax eyes\") or other content that might disrupt the user's enjoyment of the video game.\"Fast forwarding to Apple's patent FIG. 9 above, we're able to see a flow chart of illustrative operations involved in operating a head-mounted device; FIG. 10 is a side view of illustrative lens and an associated vision correction lens; and FIG. 11 is a front view of an illustrative vision correction lens coupled to a lens mount.In patent fig. 11 we're able to magnets as part of the vision system. In part Apple notes that \"to place vision correction lens #130 (shown in FIG. 10) into a desired rotational alignment with respect to structure #134 and the rest of THE HMD, ring #132 may be provided with one or more magnets such as magnets #138 and #140 and structure #134 may be provided with one or more corresponding magnets #136 and #142.Finally, Apple notes that the user input includes an eyeglasses prescription and the control circuitry is configured to adjust a position of the display with the positioner based on the eyeglasses prescription.Apple's patent application that was published today by the U.S. Patent Office was filed back in Q4 2019 with some work dating back to May 2017 being included in this application Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.Apple InventorsJonny (Hyungryul) Choi: Engineering Manager; Investigates new display and optical technologies for future Apple products.A second Patent Application relating to Apple's future HMD and glass devices was published today under number 20200174255. If you happen to be an optical engineer familiar with hologram structures, reflection holograms, transmission holograms and computer-generated holography (CGH) displays, then you may stand a chance at understanding the depth of Apple's invention titled \"Optical Systems with Multi-Layer Holographic Combiners.\" The patent that mentions Hologram 146 times could be reviewed here.Posted by Jack Purcher on June 04, 2020 at 02:46 PM in 1.

", "The artificial intelligence market consists of sales of the artificial intelligence software and related services. Artificial Intelligence (AI) sometimes referred to as machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a wide-ranging branch of computer science related with building smart machines that can perform tasks that require human intelligence. North America was the largest region in the artificial intelligence market in 2019. Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region in the forecast period. In January 2020, Apple acquired a Seattle based startup xnor.ai for a $200 million. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Apple in delivering AI capabilities. Xnor.ai is listed in 2019 Forbes AI 50: America's most promising artificial intelligence companies.The artificial intelligence market covered in this report is segmented by offering into hardware; software; services. It is also segmented by technology into machine learning; natural language processing; context-aware computing; computer vision; others (image processing, speech recognition) and by end-user industry into healthcare; automotive; agriculture; retail; marketing; telecommunication; defense; aerospace; media & entertainment; others.The limited number of AI Experts is a major challenge to the artificial intelligence market. To develop the AI software the company needs AI experts, practitioners, and researchers. According to the research report by Tencent in 2017, a Chinese tech giant, there are 300k AI researchers and practitioners worldwide but the market demand is around millions of roles. The limited number of AI experts may impact the growth of the artificial intelligence market.Automated machine learning is being implemented by many companies. It is quite complicated to apply traditional machine learning models for real-world business problems. The better solution is to use automated machine learning which allows non-machine learning (ML) experts to use machine learning algorithms without being machine learning wizards. For instance, tools like \"Google cloud AutoML\" are used to train custom made and high-quality ML models with a minimum ML expertise.Growing investment in AI technologies contributed to the growth of the artificial intelligence market. Many companies are investing in AI technologies or AU start-ups to increase the efficiency of AI software as AI enables them make more informed decisions and achieve better results. For instance, Microsoft has invested around $1 billion in OpenAI a San Francisco company. The two companies had formed a partnership to develop AI supercomputing technologies on Microsoft's cloud Azure. AI is useful across multiple sectors. For instance, AI can lead to breakthroughs in R&D and diagnostics in healthcare sector. It can help make better forecasts in finance, manufacturing, and can increase production controls and efficiency. Therefore, the rise in investment in AI technologies due to its advantages in every sector is driving the growth of the artificial intelligence market.  Key Topics Covered:   1. Executive Summary 2.

This means information technology, or more specifically, Apple, now has more bearing on Buffett's portfolio than his entire financial sector holdings. In fact, at one brief point recently, Apple comprised more than 40% of the Oracle of Omaha's invested assets.Image source: Apple.Then again, we also know that Warren Buffett is a big fan of Apple and how CEO Tim Cook is guiding the company. Over the past year and a half, Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its money on Apple, proving that Buffett still has what it takes to spot a winner.There's absolutely no question that Apple is a dominant force in the smartphone space, and the company has a veritable cult-like following for its products. When Apple does debut a new 5G-capable iPhone, it's likely going to generate a record amount of revenue from smartphone sales and benefit from a multiyear upgrade cycle.But the Apple story is about more than just smartphones. Cook is transitioning Apple to be a major player in the services realm. In recent quarters, Apple has had little issue delivering double-digit growth in wearables and services, which are generally higher-margin categories than commoditized products like smartphones and tablets.Buffett is also a big fan of Apple leaning on cheap cash to fund aggressive share buybacks as well as one of the largest dividends (in aggregate) in the world. That's because Buffett is also no stranger to borrowing at record-low rates, or repurchasing his company's stock at a perceived discount.Long story short, this isn't a purposeful changing of the guard in Buffett's portfolio so much as it is representative of the recent underperformance and calculated selling of financials, and the outperformance of big tech stocks like Apple.", "When Jio set out to launch a set-top box, it tasked a team with analysing - and in some cases replicating - some 100 features of an Apple TV set-top box last year, according to a person close to the project and internal Jio documents seen by Reuters.\"Presentation and listing of menu items should be similar to Apple TV,\" one of the documents says, assigning the task a \"Priority 1\" rating.One document compares the products' features, like average weight. Another includes instructions like \"Matching the background theme of Launcher (home screen) to that of Apple TV.\"Jio's set-top box comes included in its broadband plans, with the cheapest annual deal costing around $110, whereas Apple TV 4K is selling for around $210 to $230 on Indian e-commerce sites.Apple Inc did not respond to requests for comment.Apple Inc did not respond to requests for comment.", "Major Players in TV Set-Top Box are: \u2022 Pace \u2022 Arris (Motorola) \u2022 EchoStar Corporation \u2022 Samsung Group \u2022 Technicolor SA \u2022 Hisense \u2022 Huawei Technologies Co.

Are they still usable for planting this year or should I invest in new seeds?Q: Hope that you are doing well in these difficult times. We have an issue that we would like you to give us some advice on. I have done some research on the Internet and believe that the problem with our trees is something called apple rust. The juniper trees are Wichita Blue junipers, and our crabapple tree is a non-fruit producing tree. What we did not know when we purchased the trees is that we should not have planted junipers in close proximity to crabapple trees. We have learned that the two together tend to develop the apple rust fungus and pass it back and forth.Late last summer we noticed brown knots around a number of branches on all of the junipers. We carefully removed as many as we could find from the junipers. This past summer we also noticed that the crabapple tree was not producing leaves and flowers the way that it had in the past. This past winter we noticed that one of the junipers has some brown branches, especially at the top of the treeCan we hope to save these trees from the fungus, or should we be removing either the apple tree or the junipers to stop the spread of the fungus? Will a fungicide spray help to control the fungus? If so, what do you recommend? Are the brown branches on the one juniper caused by something else, or is the tree simply in a shock mode, so to speak, from the fungus and maybe from this past winter weather and very wet summer?A: I\u2019m not totally convinced that the problem is juniper apple rust. What you didn\u2019t include in your description is whether the brown knots transformed into an orange, gelatinous blob with finger-like projections in the spring. That is the telltale sign that the issue is the fungal rust. It may well be that this is the problem and by cutting off the knots, as you described them, you removed the orange blobs that would have formed in spring.The spores from these gelatinous \u2018creatures\u2019 send out spores onto the apple. The spores result in red bumps on the leaves of the apple that progress into powdery orange spots. The disease does not usually kill the tree but can be very unsightly.Treatment involves removing one of the hosts, either the junipers or crabapple tree. You can also keep cutting off the knots, or spray the apple trees with a copper spray starting in May and repeating every 10 days. Yes, the browning of the junipers maybe totally unrelated and is likely winter kill.", "Still, the Nasdaq 100 became the first U.S. equity index to reclaim its intraday record high, powered by the NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes Facebook Inc, Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Netflix and Alphabet Inc.

Despite offering a free year of service to anyone that buys a new Apple device and pricing the service at just $4.99 per month for everyone else, the tech titan hasn't grabbed the attention of most consumers. Various media reports put Apple TV+ viewers somewhere between 10 million and 33 million.Despite its slow start, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee sees Apple TV+ reaching 100 million subscribers by 2025. He points to several factors including a growing content library with the quality of new titles improving, a massive content budget supported by Apple's hoards of cash, and underpenetration of its install base.On top of that, Apple hasn't spent much on marketing the service since its launch, and it's looking to expand beyond its original-content-only strategy.Apple TV+ original The Morning Show. Image source: Apple.Apple TV+ launched with just eight titles. It now has 28 titles in the library, Chatterjee points out, and that number continues to grow. While Apple's content library is dwarfed by competitors like Disney (NYSE:DIS)\u00a0and\u00a0Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it's quickly expanding. It has 33 more series ordered or in development and nine films slated for the service. Chatterjee points out that newer shows have received better reviews than early series on Apple TV+. So not only is the library getting bigger, it's getting better.Importantly, Apple's budget for the streaming service is likely far greater than most of its competitors. It's spending as much as $6 billion, which is surpassed only by Netflix. Even Disney is spending just $2.5 billion on Disney+ this year, with the budget growing to around $5 billion by 2024.Apple made news recently when it agreed to produce Martin Scorsese's next film, Killers of the Flower Moon, which has a whopping $200 million budget. Apple can afford to make big bets like that thanks to the massive cash flow from the rest of its business. It generated $13.3 billion in operating cash flow during the second quarter.Apple's also looking at ways to broaden the library beyond originals. It licensed the back catalog of Fraggle Rock in a deal to reboot the series. It's also considering licensing other old series to broaden its library of shows and provide content for subscribers to watch while they wait for the next original series release.Another consideration may be sports rights. Apple recently signed Jim DeLorenzo away from fellow FAANG stock\u00a0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). DeLorenzo was instrumental in Amazon's sports strategy, which brought two kinds of football -- NFL and English Premier League -- to Amazon Prime, among other sports rights. There are a lot of sports rights contracts coming up for renewal over the next couple years, and Apple may throw its hat (and wallet) into the ring to win streaming rights.Beyond its extended free trials for new device purchasers and a big launch campaign in November, Apple doesn't seem to have spent much on marketing Apple TV+. Ads for new Apple TV+ originals have been sparse in recent months despite the boom in streaming. Perhaps it's working to build up the content library first, allowing customers on trials to watch and review shows without requiring a financial commitment, before it makes a big marketing push at the end of the year.A marketing ramp-up that coincides with the expiration of yearlong trials could help Apple convert existing viewers into paid subscribers while bringing in new ones. With an installed base of over 1 billion devices, Apple has a broad audience who have also shown at least some affinity toward its products that it can easily reach. The company is also looking to leverage its position in podcasting to promote shows on Apple TV+.A late 2020 marketing push is in line with Chatterjee's expectation for a slow ramp in subscriber growth through the rest of 2020, but strong renewal rates from free trials and increased adoption among Apple-device owners going forward.Apple will have to ramp up the marketing spend to reach 100 million subscribers, but the payoff could be significant. One hundred million paid subscribers translates into $6 billion in incremental recurring revenue compared to today. While that might only get it to breakeven based on its $6 billion in expenses, Apple's decision to focus on originals means most of its content costs aren't recurring. It can grow its total overall content library without huge increases in its annual content expenses. So growing beyond that number would make the service very profitable, very quickly.", "Apple Inc has started rolling out its iOS 13.5.5 beta version to all the developers and other people who have participated in the beta program.\u00a0The new beta version is reportedly just a timely feature and has\u00a0quick fixes to older versions of the program.

A key element of this thesis is that Apple saw oversized growth in the preceding fiscal year thanks to the iPhone 6/6 Plus, which satisfied pent-up demand for larger-screen iPhones, according to FoolWith the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, Apple has introduced a number of key features and upgrades contrast to the hugely successful iPhone 6/6 Plus, respectively. However, there is still considerable debate as to whether these devices will be enough to really drive year-over-year iPhone revenue growth.I think Apple may have a proverbial ace up its sleeve to considerably boost the companys chances of posting another year of iPhone growth: the iPhone 7c.

According to the report, Apple is putting each set-up through its paces to see what works best.1) Apple will launch a couple of new iPhones in September 2016. This theory that Apple will push the launch forward to summer 2016 seems thin to us.2) We expect a 4.7-inch phone (called the iPhone 7), and a 5.5-inch model (the iPhone 7 Plus). If Apple does make another 4-inch iPhone (which, thanks to the success of the larger iPhones, is by no means a certainty) then we think itll be called something like the iPhone 7 mini.3) The iPhone 7 is likely to get a substantial physical redesign after the largely identical iPhone 6/6s generations. Its too early to know what direction Apple will pick, but its likely to be thinner than ever: putting the cut-down headphone socket patent into action would be one way to assist achieve this. Or even removing the headphone jack entirely, and forcing music fans to use wireless Bluetooth headphones, or headphones that connect via the Lightning port, or an adaptor.4) Higher screen resolution is a possibility  Apple undermined its own Retina is as sharp as your eyes can see myth with the iPhone 6 Plus, and the company is playing catchup against many of its rivals in terms of screen resolution. Apple may well take the higher pixel density that was exclusive to the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus (401 pixels per inch, as contrast to 326ppi for all non-Plus iPhones), and apply it to all the models in the next generation; it could even raise the pixel density further than this, although we fear that this is unlikely. And a harder screen material would play well, whether Apple manages to resurrect the sapphire situation or goes with Cornings new Project Phire.Apple usually keeps the same design for two generations of the iPhone (the 4 and 4s, say, or the 6 and 6s), before unveiling a physical redesign on the next update. We expect the iPhone 7 to be fundamentally different in look and design to the two generations of iPhone that precede it.Its possible that Apple will use different materials to make the iPhone 7 more durable. Before the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were unveiled there was speculation that Apple would use Sapphire glass for the display and Liquidmetal for the chassis, and two generations later APple may be ready to unveil one or both of these upgrades.Apple Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, education, and enterprise and government customers in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Rest of Asia Pacific.Apple Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, education, and enterprise and government customers in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Rest of Asia Pacific.Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), inclined 0.28% to $117.67, during its current trading session.Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), inclined 0.28% to $117.67, during its current trading session.", " Apple is trying to help developers build password management applications which are compatible with most platforms.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) $7 to $8 billion a year so its search platform is made the default iOS search engine and Apple. But this relationship could come to an end soon, according to Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi, one of the Street\u2019s most notable Apple analysts.Search giant Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) pays Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) $7 to $8 billion a year so its search platform is made the default iOS search engine and Apple. But this relationship could come to an end soon, according to Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi, one of the Street\u2019s most notable Apple analysts.Apple\u2019s relationship with Google is far from a one-way street as Google generates a return from its annual payment to Apple, Sacconaghi explained on CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\u201d Specifically, Google generates around $25 billion in search-related revenue from being the default iOS search engine.The reason why Google feels compelled to pay Apple so much money is to prevent rival search operator Bing, owned by Microsoft, from doing so itself.While Google is the clear dominant leader in the online search space with an 88.16% market share, Bing holds a 6.51% market share as part of the multi-billion dollar market. So if one day Microsoft decides investing in search is no longer a priority, Apple loses a lot of its leverage against Google.As such, the possibility of a counter bid from Microsoft is thrown out the window, and Google could renegotiate terms at a fraction of the current $7 to $8 billion, according to the analyst. So Apple would need to find an \u201cinexpensive insurance policy\u201d to keep Google at the table and continue paying billions of dollars.Here is a guide on how investors can buy Apple shares.Apple doesn\u2019t have a way of monetizing search on its iOS platform since it doesn\u2019t own or operate an engine. As such, Apple may want to consider buying DuckDuckGo, the fourth largest search engine with a market share of 1.35%.The price tag on a potential deal would be less than $1 billion which is the equivalent of just a few days worth of cash flow. For such a small amount, Apple is essentially sending a message to the other search providers that it can run its own search business if needed.Popular Apple blog Cult of Mac noted DuckDuckGo and Apple share very similar stances on privacy. Apple believes it is a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and the company \u201cpurposely\u201d designs its products and services to limit the collection of consumer data.", "Launch of Quick Look by Apple to Boost Market Prospects Apple, Inc., an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California released Quick look, an augmented reality (AR) tool, which is featured in iOS and iPad OS. The new tool will allow users to see certain products directly in their environment. The new AR tool, Quick look, is predicted to aid E-commerce companies. It will provide the customers the ability to choose products as per their requirements while making the product look-real-like in their own space, which will lessen product returns and boost sales. The launch of the new tool will aid the augmented reality (AR) market revenue owing to the features of the tool, such as spatial audio and next-level user experience. Moreover, with the new update, now developers can add a purchase button (that will open up Apple Pay), or use a support window to chat with customers. In addition, the focus of companies towards the integration of Artificial intelligence in AR will also subsequently fuel the demand for augmented reality in the forthcoming years.North America generated a revenue of USD 2.12 billion in 2018 and is predicted to remain dominant during the forecast period owing to the presence of various companies such as Google LLC, Facebook, Inc., and Apple, Inc. Furthermore, the rising R&D investment in the development of the augmented reality in the U.S.\u00a0 The implementation of various government initiatives and startups for advanced AR technology will create new opportunities for the AR/VR market trends in North America.

The Apple Card neither charges an annual fee nor a late fee.Apple has already assisted Apple Card customers by extending a payment deferment program through June, helping those who are enduring financial hardship during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Apple\u2019s Growing Card Payment ServicesApple is updating its privacy policy for Apple Card to enable sharing more anonymized data with Goldman Sachs. We believe that the updated policy will help Goldman Sachs in creating a new credit assignment model.Moreover, Apple introduced an opt-in option, allowing users to share more data with Goldman Sachs if they don't get approved for the Apple Card at first pass. The data will require users\u2019 Apple product and service purchase history, how long a user has had an Apple ID, and how much they routinely spend with Apple.The above initiatives are part of Apple's effort to expand beyond the iPhone into boosting revenues from its gamut of services.In second-quarter fiscal 2020, Services revenues grew 16.6% from the year-ago quarter to $13.35 billion, a record in the company\u2019s history.

With the smartphone market becoming saturated in recent years Apple has been focusing more on services. For its second quarter, which it reported in April,\u00a0services revenue jumped 17% year-over-year hitting $13.3 billion, which was an all-time revenue record for that part of its business.\u00a0Beyond Apple TV+ and Apple Music, its streaming services, Apple has News+, and Apple Arcade, its gaming service. As stand-alone services, Apple Music and News+ sets customers back $10 a month, while Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade are $5 monthly. Combined it costs $30 a month to access all of Apple's services.

That resurgence can be attributed to co-founder Steve Jobs, who returned as Apple's CEO in 1997 and disrupted the digital music, smartphone, and tablet markets with sleek, easy-to-use products.Customers lined up to pay a premium for those products, and Apple locked them into its walled garden with its App Store and other software services. Jobs passed away in 2011, but Apple's stock has risen more than 500% since then as CEO Tim Cook upgraded Jobs' core products, introduced new devices like the Apple Watch, and expanded the company's software ecosystem with new services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+.Image source: Apple.But under Cook, Apple has struggled with slowing sales of smartphones and tougher competition from Android devices. Jony Ive, who designed Apple's most significant hardware devices after Jobs' return, also left the company. Apple's increased focus on dividends and buybacks have also suggested its high-growth days were over.Will Apple still generate more millionaire-making returns in the future? Or is it becoming a mature tech stock that is owned for dividends and stability instead of growth?Apple's biggest weakness is its overwhelming dependence on\u00a0the iPhone, which generated 57% of its revenue last quarter. Apple's iPhone sales rose 2% annually during the quarter, but it's clearly running out of room to grow in the saturated smartphone market.Apple's market share remains steady: It controlled 14% of\u00a0the global smartphone market in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research, up from 12% a year earlier but down from 18% in the fourth quarter. However, IDC expects global smartphone shipments to\u00a0decline at a compound annual growth rate of -0.7% between 2019 and 2024, which will make it increasingly difficult for Apple to grow its biggest business.Apple is trying to boost its iPhone revenue with cheaper devices like the entry-level iPhone 11 and the new iPhone SE, but these new phones could merely help Apple to tread water instead of swim forward. On the bright side, the arrival of\u00a0new 5G iPhones later this year could light a fresh fire under the business as 4G customers finally upgrade to 5G plans.Apple's Mac and iPad businesses are also losing momentum, due to long upgrade cycles and intense competition. The COVID-19 crisis might temporarily boost demand for Macbooks and iPad Pros as more people work or attend classes remotely, but both product lines face intense long-term competition from cheaper Windows laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 devices like Microsoft's Surface.In short, Apple's core hardware sales could stagnate over the next few years, and it could struggle to offset those declines with its new higher-growth businesses.Image source: Apple.Apple's greatest strength is arguably its cash. It ended last quarter with $192.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which gives it plenty of room for buybacks, dividend hikes, investments, and acquisitions.Apple has already ramped up its investments in next-gen markets like augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital healthcare, and those seeds could eventually sprout and yield new hardware devices. It's also developing more first-party chips and components to streamline its supply chain and reduce its dependence on third-party suppliers.Apple's AirPods and Apple Watch, two core components of the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment that generated 11% of its revenue last quarter, are also faring well.Apple reportedly sold over\u00a060 million AirPods last year, according to Strategy Analytics, and accounted for 71% of all wireless headphone sales worldwide. The firm also estimates Apple Watch shipments rose 36% in 2019 to\u00a030.7 million, as the entire Swiss watch industry's shipments fell 13% to 21.1 million. In April, Apple claimed over 75% of its Apple Watch buyers during the\u00a0second quarter were new to the product.Apple's family of subscription services hit 515 million paid subscribers last quarter, up from 125 million a year ago. It expects that figure to reach 600 million by the end of the year, which indicates its Services revenue, which rose 17% annually and accounted for 17% of its top line last quarter, will continue climbing as it locks more users into its walled garden.The growth of that sticky ecosystem, which is tightly tethered to its hardware devices, could spell trouble for rivals like streaming video giant Netflix\u00a0and streaming music leader Spotify. It also reinforces Apple's brand appeal and loyalty, which widens its moat against premium Android challengers like Samsung and Huawei.With a market cap of $1.4 trillion, it's highly doubtful Apple will replicate its massive gains of the past two decades. However, the stock isn't expensive at 22 times forward earnings, and it pays a passable forward dividend yield of 1%.Investors who want millionaire-making returns should probably seek out higher-growth stocks with smaller market caps. However, investors who want stable stocks to hold for decades should stick with Apple -- which should be valued more like a consumer goods company than a tech one.", "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 8, 2020 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

The new services allow developers to integrate website-specific requirements used by its iCloud Keychain password manager to generate strong, unique passwords.Apple says that having password managers collaborate on together using its resources has multiple benefits. This includes the fact that by sharing resources, all password managers can collectively improve their quality with less work than it might take for any individual password manager to reach on their own.Ultimately, Apple notes that, \"by improving the quality of password managers, we improve user trust in them as a concept, which benefits everyone.\"Via ZDNet", "Companies Profiled in this report includes: PTC, Apple Inc, Atheer, Inc, Inglobe Technologies, mantis vision ltd, Microsoft, Object Theory LLC., RE\u2019FLEKT GmbH, SAMSUNG, \u00a0Vuzix CorporationCompanies Profiled in this report includes: PTC, Apple Inc, Atheer, Inc, Inglobe Technologies, mantis vision ltd, Microsoft, Object Theory LLC., RE\u2019FLEKT GmbH, SAMSUNG, \u00a0Vuzix Corporation13.2.

And As always, we wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today.Apple has been granted patent 10,681,141 for HomeKit, a smarthome app that will grow in importance over time. \u00a0Apple's patent covers an application (e.g., home application) on a device (e.g., laptop, mobile device, wearable device, etc.) may be used to control other devices, such as accessory devices (e.g., kitchen appliances, lighting fixtures, thermometer, etc.), throughout a home. A user of the home application may be in the same room as the accessory device that is controlled or may be in a different room from the accessory device that is being controlled. For example, a user may be in their kitchen when they use the home application on their mobile device to close the garage door.Apple has been granted patent 10,681,843 for MacBooks having adaptive surfaces. The adaptive surfaces are deformable from a first configuration to at least a second configuration responsive to a temperature change such as a temperature change caused by heat generated by an electronic component within the housing, or responsive to a mechanical strain on the surface. For instance, if a MacBook gets too hot, the seemingly smooth surface of the MacBook cover could have distinct portion that would spring open so as to cool the temperature of the MacBook. You could check out our April 2019 report for more details and patent figures here.Apple has been granted patent 10,680,161 for Electronic Devices with Piezoelectric Ink. The image above is an example relating to Apple Watch with piezoelectric components.Apple notes that Input-output devices may include piezoelectric components. The piezoelectric components may include piezoelectric fluid or ink in which piezoelectric particles are dispersed in a binder. The piezoelectric ink may be deposited on a substrate.

In this particular report we cover Apple's patent relating to a mixed reality headset with a Dynamic Focus 3D Display. While Conventional VR systems project left and right images onto screens that are viewed by a subject, Apple new way uses a direct retinal projector system that scans the images, pixel by pixel, directly onto the subject's retinas.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of X newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover Apple's patent relating to a mixed reality headset with a Dynamic Focus 3D Display. While Conventional VR systems project left and right images onto screens that are viewed by a subject, Apple new way uses a direct retinal projector system that scans the images, pixel by pixel, directly onto the subject's retinas.According to Apple, conventional virtual reality and augmented reality systems may suffer from accommodation-convergence mismatch problems that cause eyestrain, headaches, and/or nausea. Accommodation-convergence mismatch arises when a VR or AR system effectively confuses the brain of a user by generating scene content that does not match the depth expected by the brain based on the stereo convergence of the two eyes of the user.Accommodation-convergence mismatch problems are undesirable and may distract users or otherwise detract from their enjoyment and endurance levels (i.e. tolerance) of virtual reality or augmented reality environments. Apple's invention is to overcome this issue.Apple's granted patent that was never published as a patent application under \"Apple\" covers methods and apparatus for providing dynamic focusing 3D display for virtual reality (VR) and/or augmented reality (AR) systems.While Conventional VR systems project left and right images onto screens that are viewed by a subject, Apple new way uses a direct retinal projector system that scans the images, pixel by pixel, directly onto the subject's retinas. This aspect of direct retinal projector systems allows individual pixels to be optically affected dynamically as the images are scanned to the subject's retinas.

Fintiv, Inc.\u00a0issued on May 13, 2020, the PTAB denied institution of Apple\u2019s petition for IPR and set forth a new test for determining whether to institute an IPR based on the status of the underlying district court proceedings, which suggests that institution rates may continue to fall.In a landmark decision designated as precedential or binding, the PTAB recently exercised its discretion under \u00a7314(a) to deny institution of an IPR petition filed by Apple against Fintiv, Inc., a company that develops mobile commerce platforms to support mobile marketing and mobile payments.[5]\u00a0 In\u00a0Apple, the PTAB announced and applied a new six-factor test to be used in determining whether to deny institution based on the advanced status of the underlying district court case.\u00a0 Technically, the six factors were articulated in the PTAB\u2019s order authorizing supplemental briefing on whether to grant a discretionary denial a couple months earlier,[6]\u00a0and a different list of non-exclusive factors was set forth in\u00a0General Plastic Co., Ltd. v. Canon Kabushiki Kaisha,[7]\u00a0but the present six-factor test was not designated as precedential until the PTAB\u2019s May 13, 2020 decision.\u00a0 In any event, the parties\u2019 dispute began when Fintiv filed suit against Apple for patent infringement in the Western District of Texas.[8]\u00a0 Apple filed its IPR petition ten months later, and the parties were in the relatively early stages of discovery when the PTAB issued its decision.\u00a0 In denying institution, the PTAB announced and considered the following six factors: (1) whether the District Court had granted a stay or evidence exists that the Court would grant a stay if the IPR were instituted; (2) the proximity of the court\u2019s trial date to the PTAB\u2019s expected deadline for a final decision in the IPR proceeding; (3) the investment by the parties and the court in the district court proceedings; (4) the degree of overlap between the issues raised in the IPR and the district court case; (5) whether the parties in the two proceedings are the same; and (6) any other factors that might affect the Board\u2019s discretion, including the merits of the IPR petition.[9]First, the PTAB observed that neither party had requested a stay pending the IPR and \u201cdeclined to infer\u201d whether a stay would be granted if the IPR were instituted, which did not weigh for or against institution.\u00a0 Second, the PTAB noted that trial in the district court was expected to occur two months before the Board\u2019s deadline for a final decision in the IPR proceeding, which weighed in favor of a discretionary denial.[10]\u00a0 Third, even though fact discovery was only \u201cin its early stages, with document production ongoing and depositions just getting underway,\u201d the PTAB noted that the district court had issued a Markman ruling, and the parties had exchanged their final infringement and invalidity contentions.[11]\u00a0 Based on the parties\u2019 investment in the district court case, the PTAB considered this factor to weigh \u201csomewhat in favor\u201d of a discretionary denial.[12]\u00a0 Fourth, although Apple had raised additional invalidity contentions in the district court case that were not at issue in the IPR, the PTAB reasoned that the assertion of additional invalidity contentions in the District Court is \u201cnot relevant to the question of the degree of overlap.\u201d\u00a0 Instead, because the identical patent claims were challenged in both proceedings, and because \u201csame [prior] art\u201d was presented in both proceedings, this factor weighed in favor of discretionary denial.[13]\u00a0 Fifth, because Apple and Fintiv were parties in both proceedings, this factor also weighed against institution.\u00a0 Finally, the PTAB\u2019s \u201cinitial inspection\u201d of Apple\u2019s petition revealed \u201ccertain weaknesses,\u201d such as where the prior art disclosed certain steps and other claimed features.\u00a0 In conclusion, the PTAB determined that the balance of factors weighed in favor of discretionary denial and that \u201cefficiency is best served by denying institution.\u201d[14][5]\u00a0Apple, Inc. v.

The analyst has been quite bullish on the iPhone maker ever since initiating coverage with an \u2018Outperform\u2019 rating in mid-2019. Last week, Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI had predicted that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) could hit $2 trillion in market cap in the next four years. The analyst has been quite bullish on the iPhone maker ever since initiating coverage with an \u2018Outperform\u2019 rating in mid-2019. Notably, Apple became the first US company to hit the $1 trillion mark valuation in August 2018, which was followed by peer tech giants Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL). However, Alphabet was forced below this prestigious benchmark during the COVID-driven sell-off and is currently inching back towards $1 trillion. \u00a0Apple, which went public in 1980, hit $100 billion in market cap only 27 years later. Ironically, this was also the year the first iPhone was launched. Thanks to the immense popularity gained by the avant-garde gadget, it took only five more years for the valuation to hit $500 billion. Keeping in view that Apple doubled its first $500 billion market cap in just five years and tripled in another two years, hitting $2 trillion appears an easy target based on historical performance in the market. \u00a0Of late, we have seen Apple\u2019s services segment offsetting some of the weakness seen on iPhone sales. The Services unit will play a key role in Apple\u2019s journey to $2 trillion as it increases its revenue contribution to approximately $100 billion. Wearables, which has been gaining more acceptance among consumers over the past few years, is expected to continue posting double-digit growths to around $60 billion by 2024. \u00a0\u00a0From fiscal 2015 to 2019, revenue from this business \u2013 which includes iCloud, Apple Music, App Store, Apple Arcade, etc \u2013 has grown at an average of 23%. At the end of fiscal 2019, the company had registered revenues of $46.3 billion. So if it continues to achieve the current rate of annual growth, that would take it to $106.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2024. Apple has been transforming itself into a services platform over the past few years, increasing its revenue dependence on the high-margin Services segment. While it accounted for less than 10% of total revenues in fiscal 2015, the uptrend over the years suggests Services could contribute at least a third of Apple\u2019s overall revenues by 2024.

The iPhone-maker is expected to launch its first 5G-supported device later this year. Additionally, continued momentum in the Services segment backed by strong App Store sales and robust acceptance of Apple Music and Apple Pay is expected to drive the stock\u2019s growth this year.Moreover, the company\u2019s wearables market domination is expected to continue in 2020 owing to strong adoption of AirPods and Apple Watch. The solid uptake of Apple Watch Series 5 is helping the iPhone maker strengthen presence in the personal health monitor space.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B.

Those affected were advised to stay away from three domains, namely:  Our WHOIS Lookup queries revealed that www-appleid[.]com, www-appleofficial[.]com, and www-appleoficial[.]com were all 4 days old when the alert was given and belong to an individual based in Mexico. As far as we can tell from the lookup reports, the domain owner has no ties to Apple. According to the domains' WHOIS records, he is part of an organization called \"Fastunlock.\"  In light of the campaign, we looked at our typosquatting database for other relevant domains that users should avoid accessing. We found 160 domains containing \"appleid\" from feeds dated 1 October 2019 to 3 April 2020. Of these, 45 domains or around 28% (e.g., appleidinformation[.]com, my-appleid[.]app, appleid-lockedmail[.]com, webapps-appleid-apple2[.]com, createappleid[.]org. etc.) had malicious ties according to TIP. A Bulk WHOIS Search query also showed that Apple owned none of the 160 domains.  Organizations that want to exert due diligence can go even further than just blocking access to the malicious domains. Subjecting them to a DNS lookup can reveal malicious IP addresses that may need to be blacklisted as well, such as 74[.]220[.]199[.]6, which appleid-manage[.]net resolves to.  And while the majority of the domains were not cited for malicious ties, knowing that they don't belong to Apple may be reason enough to avoid accessing them. Users can quickly determine if that's the case via WHOIS lookups.  Most of the non-malicious domains were registered by privacy-protected individuals from countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, the U.S., Iran, Japan, and Germany. Some even went as far as redacting their country information. That is very different from the WHOIS record of the real AppleID domain (i.e., appleid[.]apple[.]com) indicates Apple Inc. as the owner, complete with the company's postal and email address and phone numbers, as shown in this WHOIS Lookup report.  Most of the non-malicious domains were registered by privacy-protected individuals from countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, the U.S., Iran, Japan, and Germany. Some even went as far as redacting their country information. That is very different from the WHOIS record of the real AppleID domain (i.e., appleid[.]apple[.]com) indicates Apple Inc. as the owner, complete with the company's postal and email address and phone numbers, as shown in this WHOIS Lookup report.  It's also interesting to note the use of what appear to be randomly generated numbers in some of the non-malicious domains such as customer-support-appleid96210[.]com, customer-support-appleid89487[.]com, and customer-support-appleid69841[.]com. That is another significant difference from legitimate Apple domains such as that of AppleID Support \u2014 support[.]apple[.]com/apple-id.  Some non-malicious domains also included what are likely to be other brands mixed with AppleID such as in zendappleid-support2[.]com, appleid-websecuremeklor[.]com, and appleidsupportgmail[.]info.  Misspellings and grammatical errors, which no reputable company like Apple is likely to make, also appear in some of the non-malicious domains, including com-appleid-noticed[.]com (note the use of the verb in the past tense \"noticed\" instead of the noun \"notice\"), appleidsupports[.]info (singular verb form \"supports\" instead of the noun \"support\"), and safaty-appleid[.]com (\"safaty\" should probably be \"safety\").  Other discrepancies include unnecessary letters (e.g., appleidapple-updatepaymentxxx[.]com), place names (e.g., appleidservicesjp[.]com), and missing dashes for words written separately (e.g., secure-mailservicesappleid[.]net \u2014 should ideally be structured as secure-mail-service-sappleid[.]net).  All of these are uncharacteristic of AppleID domains and should probably be treated as red flags or cause for suspicion at least. Apple device owners can stay protected from any danger both the malicious and non-malicious domains pose by refraining from accessing them or marking all emails originating from them as spam.

Apple in March asked employees to telecommute because of the coronavirus pandemic.The reported plan to reopen the campus to select employees is part of a multiphase roadmap. The majority of workers aren\u2019t expected to return to the headquarters, officially known as Apple Park, for several months.Apple\u2019s internal memo is said to have specified that employees who will receive access next week will be required to wear face masks at all times. There will be other restrictions as well, including mandatory temperature checks and a limit on the number of days per week employees can be in Apple Park. The iPhone maker will reportedly also cap how many\u00a0employees can gather in a given area.The safety policies outlined in the memo are said to apply to Apple\u2019s nearby Infinite Loop campus too, which served as its headquarters until 2017.The second phase of the reopening is scheduled to start next month, according to Bloomberg. But Apple told employees that the plan may change depending on local and state stay-at-home orders.Employees began returning to some of Apple\u2019s global offices in May. The company has reopened\u00a0more than half of its 510 retail stores worldwide as of earlier this month and some personnel, including a few engineers and executives, are reportedly already back at work at Apple Park.Apple\u2019s transition to remote work earlier this year is said to have\u00a0involved\u00a0some challenges because of the company\u2019s well-known secrecy about its product development initiatives. The company has, among other things, a policy of preventing unreleased products from being taken off campus.

Notably, the same technology is used in Apple\u2019s own designed iPhone and iPad chips. Other notable PC-makers like Microsoft, Lenovo and Samsung also launched notebooks supported by Arm-based chips.Apple\u2019s transition from Intel to Arm-based architecture is primarily driven by the speed factor. In internal tests, Arm-based Macs reportedly did better over Intel-based versions in terms of handling graphics and AI-propelled apps.

Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock managed to produce a new 52-week high as the company prepares to launch new iPhones later this year.Despite abysmal demand for iPhones over the past few months, shares of Apple carved out a new 52-week high on Wednesday. The stock was up about 2.4% by early afternoon.U.S. iPhone sales were reportedly down 77% in April, according to data from KeyBanc, as Americans stayed home amid the pandemic. Apple's fiscal second quarter, which ended on March 28, only captured a small portion of the carnage. Global iPhone sales were down just 6.7% year over year.Apple's fiscal third quarter results are likely to look much worse, although investors may be betting on strong demand for 5G iPhones expected to launch later this year. Delays are possible due to supply chain disruptions, but the stock seems to be pricing in some serious pent-up demand.One problem with this narrative: The U.S. is now officially in a recession, and there's no telling how bad the economy will be come September, when Apple typically announces new iPhones. While the first-order economic effects of the pandemic \u2013 major job losses in industries directly affected, like hospitality and restaurants \u2013 are presumably in the rearview mirror, a shock of this magnitude will likely have economic implications for years to come.Apple stock is riding high, but if the company's new iPhones are met with tepid demand later this year as consumers batten down the hatches, it's hard to imagine the tech stock not taking a hit.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In his view, 350 million of the company\u2019s 925 million iPhone customers present an upgrade opportunity.

Kuo notes that the new iPhones will only work with the sub-6GHz version of 5G. Kuo also says that Apple will begin volume production of the new iPhones in July.Apple could announce the 5G iPhone later this year but not make it available for shipment until next year. The company has followed that path before, but it seems unlikely in this case because everyone knows the switchover to 5G devices is coming and phones lacking that compatibility will not fetch premium prices from consumers.

However, buying pressure has failed to keep up with remarkable price action, grinding out weak accumulation readings that\u00a0are warning traders and investors to act cautiously in coming weeks, despite the vertical ascent.  Upgrades from Deutsche Bank, HSBC Securities, JPMorgan, and BoA/Merrill have underpinned this impressive advance, but Apple stock still faces major challenges over the next few quarters in rebuilding iPhone and hardware sales that have been hurt badly by the coronavirus outbreak and retail store shutdowns around the globe. While many American stores have reopened, continued worries about a \"second wave\" and potential impact from political unrest could undermine floor traffic and quarterly sales.  We're nearing a typically quiet period between the end of the quarter and July earnings season, with Apple set to report third quarter 2020 results on July 28. Company disclosures and news flow tend to dry up at this stage in the cycle, with rumor mills then kicking into gear during the run-up into earnings, often through Asian technology sites. The lack of catalysts could induce a gravity-driven reversal into July, with shareholders taking profits as short-term technical levels get breached.  The stock broke out above the 2000 high at a split-adjusted $5.37 in 2005, entering a powerful uptrend that topped out at $29.00 at the end of 2007.\u00a0It carved a double top pattern at that level into September 2008 and broke down, dropping to a two-year low in January 2009. That relative strength compared to broad benchmarks underpinned a strong recovery wave, making Apple one of the first blue chips to post new highs after the economic collapse.  Apple stock has broken out to an all-time high, but bearish divergences raise the odds that the rally will fail and reinforce resistance just above $300.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Intel INTC, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor TSM.Can Apple Chips Hurt Intel?A Bloomberg report said that Apple, which has been rumored to be making its own ARM-based chips for Macs for a while now, is finally in a position to announce them at its WWDC annual developers conference a couple of weeks later.This doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that the chips will be immediately available. Usually, an announcement means that they are likely through with tape out. If all goes well, the chips would be in Apple devices some time next year.And that\u2019s the crux of the matter. Nothing is expected to happen this year and even if it\u2019s announced, we don\u2019t know for sure that this iteration of the chips will actually find their way into Apple devices.While ARM designs consume less power, they haven\u2019t been able to beat Intel designs in performance. Not yet, anyway. So it seems extremely unlikely for Apple to go this route.Unless, and this is a possibility worth considering, Apple is looking to make a lower-end version of its Mac running on ARM chips. Apple could be following the same strategy that it did with the iPhone SE, i.e., making products at multiple price points to target different users. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a far-fetched idea, especially considering that people are likely to be more conservative spenders in a post-COVID world.There could also be a version using Advanced Micro Devices silicon. AMD is giving some real competition to Intel on the performance front as well, so that\u2019s another possibility Apple could be considering. And since both Apple and AMD use Taiwan Semiconductor as their foundry, it could all be rather smooth.Since Apple\u2019s announcement won\u2019t bring any immediate changes, Intel will continue to enjoy the benefits of workloads shifting to homes, both on the PC side (as home offices are set up) and on the cloud side (as these offices connect). There\u2019s also a ton of storage, networking and communications tech being deployed there, all of which will strengthen its business in the next few quarters. Also, having made these investments, companies/individuals are unlikely to upgrade/change the very next year. Apple is more likely to score with individual deals at enterprise customers, as has been its strategy in the past.So this bit of news is a positive for Apple, as it will help the company to lower cost and possibly compete for some lower-end business that will add to its premium business. But it isn\u2019t something Intel investors need to be overly concerned about because Apple is not a very big customer, because it may not sift away entirely and because some share loss to AMD was already in the cards.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This follows Apple\u2019s decision to default the \u2018always allow\u2019 function to \u2018off\u2019 for third-party apps using location tracking products and \u2018on\u2019 for its own FindMy app in iOS 13, impacting Tile\u2019s business.These changes were made by Apple in an attempt to protect user privacy settings by blocking apps that make use of location tracking. Such a move would impact Tile, which uses the functionality to help people find lost devices.In effect, therefore, Apple\u2019s changes would leave Tile high and dry, able only to help users of the smartphone in the location tracking of objects if those objects are lost while the app is open.Late last year, US lawmakers in the midst of an antitrust investigation into tech giants warned that Apple may be using privacy as a ruse for anticompetitive behavior, according to a November report by The Washington Post.The issue came to a head in January, when Tile testified against Apple\u2019s alleged anticompetitive behavior in a field hearing involving the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee in Colorado. Tile was joined in this effort by a number of other brands, including PopSockets, Sonos, and Basecamp.Tile\u2019s leaders argued at the time that the relationship between their company and Apple had been deteriorating following growing rumors that Apple was in the midst of developing its own range of location tracking products, to be called AirTags.Months later, in April, Tile claimed in a statement that the tech giant\u2019s alleged anticompetitive behaviors had \u201cgotten worse, not better,\u201d accusing Apple of reneging on its promises to reinstate Always Allow background permissions for location tracking.The escalating tension between the two companies rose further on May 29, when Tile penned a letter to the European Commission while appearing to pursue new avenues against Apple after having made little ground in the US.According to the latter, an excerpt of which was obtained by Financial Times, Apple is playing foul by favoring FindMy\u2014the tech giant\u2019s own location tracking app\u2014over Tile\u2019s in a number of different ways. The company therefore petitioned the European Commission to open a probe into Apple\u2019s business practices.\u201cIn the past twelve months, Apple has taken several steps to completely disadvantage Tile, including by making it more difficult for consumers to use our products and services,\u201d wrote Tile\u2019s general counsel Kirsten Daru in the letter. \u201cThis is particularly concerning because Apple\u2019s actions come at the same time that Apple both launched a new FindMy app that competes even more directly with Tile and also began preparing for the launch of a competitive hardware product.\u201dApple, for its part, fervently denied all of the allegations Tile had levelled against it, claiming that the company is deliberately trying to target them out.\u201cConsistent with the critical path we\u2019ve been on for over a decade, last year we introduced further privacy protections that safeguard user location data,\u201d Apple went on. \u201cTile doesn\u2019t like those decisions so instead of arguing the issue on its merits, they\u2019ve instead decided to launch meritless attacks.\u201dApple is no stranger to anticompetition allegations. Over the past years, the company has faced stern criticism from a number of companies and governments for allegedly blocking other companies from going about their business.In March, Apple was slapped with an historic $1.2 billion fine in France over antitrust violations, with the French competition watchdog finding the tech giant responsible for \u201csterilizing the market.\u201dAt present, Apple is facing a separate investigation in the EU following a series of complaints by Spotify. According to the music streaming service, in addition to issues such as App Store placement, the tech giant\u2019s 30% cut on charges made in apps using Apple Pay should be regarded as anticompetitive.Should the European Commission come out in defense of Tile in the weeks and months ahead; a fresh investigation could be launched into its location tracking updates, adding to the sea of antitrust and anticompetition charges in which Apple is already finding itself embroiled.", "As the overall market rebounds, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have not only bounced back but have also roared to a new all-time high above $350. Investors have cheered the company's ongoing transformation to a business model that is less dependent on product sales and more so on higher-margin services offerings.Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.10 years ago, Apple's growth story essentially boiled down to one product: the iPhone. But the narrative for Apple stock is much different in 2020. While the iPhone is extremely important to Apple's overall business, investors aren't planning for sales of the device to grow substantially from here. On the other hand, Apple's growth in this decade will likely come primarily from services.Today, Apple has an installed base of more than 1.5 billion active devices,\u00a0creating a massive opportunity for the company to sell services to this large user base. The company is doing that in two main ways: launching and selling its own services and profiting from its share of other services sold through its app store.Highlighting how important Apple's services segment has become to the company's overall results, fiscal 2019 services revenue grew 16% year over to $46.3 billion, accounting for 18% of total revenue. But here's the kicker: services has a much higher gross margin than Apple's products sales do, making the segment more important to the company's performance than it seems on the surface. In fiscal 2019, services gross margin was 64% compared to products gross margin of 32%. In addition, services gross margin is expanding; it increased from 60.8% in fiscal 2018 to 63.7% in fiscal 2019.Apple's offerings in its services segment have been growing recently as management capitalizes on the opportunity in front of it. Last year, the company rolled out four new services, including a news subscription service, a streaming gaming service, a streaming TV service, and a new credit card. This builds on other important native Apple services including Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. Further, Apple benefits from sales of apps across its operating systems and from particularly strong growth in third-party subscriptions. Third-party subscription revenue increased 30% year over year in Apple's fiscal second quarter (the company's most recent quarter), management said in the company's earnings call for the period. Total paid subscriptions, including both third- and first-party subscriptions, were 515 million in fiscal Q2 -- up 125 million from the year-ago quarter. In fact, these subscriptions increased 35 million sequentially, marking the most significant sequential growth in subscriptions that Apple has ever seen.Looking beyond iPhone, Apple's Mac and iPad segments have been holding their own. Mac revenue rose 2% year over year in fiscal 2019 to $25.7 billion and iPad revenue jumped 16% year over year to $21.3 billion.Apple Watch Series 5. Image source: Apple.But there's one area of Apple's products business that investors should be particularly excited about: wearables, or sales of Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones. The segment that includes sales of wearables, called \"wearables, home, and accessories,\" saw revenue surge 41% year over year to $24.5 billion in fiscal 2019, fueled by strong growth in AirPods and Apple Watch. While this segment is still much smaller than Apple's services segment (which is second in size only to iPhone), it's growing faster than services -- making it an important catalyst for Apple.Of course, investors can't escape the fact that iPhone still dominates Apple's business. In fiscal 2019, $142 billion of the company's $260 billion in total revenue came from iPhone.Overall, Apple's iPhone business looks healthy. But there's no reason to get excited about it either. In fiscal 2019, iPhone revenue fell 14% year over year. However, this was up against a tough comparison in fiscal 2018, when iPhone revenue jumped 18% year over year. More recently, the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro lineup seem to be resonating with consumers. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2020, iPhone revenue actually rose 8% year over year. Of course, iPhone revenue fell 7% year over year in fiscal Q2, but this was due to headwinds related to COVID-19.Barring any temporary setbacks from COVID-19's impact on Apple's business, the company's iPhone segment looks well-positioned for flat to moderate growth in the coming years. But it also wouldn't be surprising to see the important segment surprise to either upside or downside.Assuming Apple's iPhone business can remain competitive, Apple stock still looks compelling at $350 given its impressive momentum in services and wearables.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from a continued momentum in the Services segment, driven by strong App Store sales and the robust adoption of Apple Music and Apple Pay.Non-iPhone devices, particularly Apple Watch and AirPod, are other notable drivers in the long haul. However, iPhone sales are expected to remain bleak in the near term due to the negative impact of the coronavirus. In fact, the company expects iPhone and Wearables business revenues for the fiscal second quarter to be worse on a year-over-year basis than the fiscal first quarter.On the contrary, iPad and Mac revenues are expected to improve but lower economic activity will hurt AppleCare and advertising businesses.

Here's a selection of portable devices.Apple's professional users -- especially those working in the creative industries -- have welcomed the company's renewed focus on its professional Mac products in recent months, following the long-awaited introduction of the new Mac Pro desktop, and the 16-inch revamp of its flagship MacBook Pro laptop. But there's no doubt that Apple took its eye off the ball in the Mac market while it spent years concentrating on the iPhone, and that has given rival PC manufacturers a real opportunity to capture a slice of Apple's creative pie. After years of focusing on the iPhone, Apple turned its attention back to its traditional creative audience towards the end of 2019, with an entirely new Mac Pro, and this well-received revamp of its veteran 15-inch pro laptop.The clue's in the name, of course, and this new 16-inch MacBook Pro manages to fit a larger 16-inch display into a design that's only 9mm wider than its 15-inch predecessor, and still manages to keep the weight down to just 2kg. The 3,072 by 1,920 (226dpi) display is a delight, and supports the DCI-P3 color standard used in professional broadcasting, but Apple is also making a renewed pitch for the audio and music markets, squeezing an impressive high-quality speaker and microphone system into the MacBook Pro's slimline design.It's expensive, of course, but with 6-core and 8-core processor options, AMD Radeon Pro graphics, all-day battery life, and a new keyboard design, Apple's new top-of-the-range MacBook Pro has restored the faith of many long-time Mac users.Apple labels its laptops by year, but Dell simply slaps 'New' on the name and leaves it at that. If in doubt, the 'New' XPS 15 also has the model number '9500', which sets it apart from the older 7590 model -- which is still on sale, so make sure you choose the correct model when ordering.That's a higher resolution than Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro, and the display supports 100% of the Adobe RGB colour standard, so the New XPS 15 will be a good option for web or magazine design. However, it only manages 94% of the DCI-P3 standard used in the broadcast industries, so rivals such as the MacBook Pro may still have an edge for professional-level video editing.The company has been a little slow introducing the latest 10th-generation Intel processors, and its third-party retailers (in the UK) are currently only offering a handful of configurations based on 9th generation chips. Even so, a price of $1,899 or \u00a31,749.17 (ex. VAT) is very tempting for a model that provides 4K resolution, a six-core Core i7 processor running at 2.6GHz (up to 4.5GHz with TurboBoost) and a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU, along with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state drive. The P65 Creator only weighs 1.9kg as well, giving slimline rivals such as Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro a real run for their money.\u00a0Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020) review: New processors and new

Analysts expect that to change with the iPhone 12, which could be unveiled at WWDC.Over the course of a year or two, between 1.5 billion and 3 billion people worldwide could be upgrading their smartphones to 5G models. For companies like Apple and Samsung, the opportunity to add revenue runs into the tens of billions of dollars.While iPhone sales have dropped as a percentage of Apple\u2019s total revenue, they are still the largest driver of the top line. They accounted for $29 billion of total revenue in the most recent quarter.At some point, Apple will also need to make the Apple Watch and iPad 5G compatible. It\u2019s another factor that could push consumers to upgrade those devices more quickly.Apple may also announce a long-expected move away from Intel chips in its Mac computers. Apple reportedly will be using technology from Arm Ltd., a division of Japan\u2019s Softbank Group Corp., to build its own custom chips.While many corporations have made supportive public statements about the Black Lives Matter movement and recent calls for police reform, Apple is opening its wallet, in a big way. On Thursday, the company pledged $100 million to a new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.Cook said Apple will aim to increase spending with black-owned suppliers, and expand work with historically black colleges.Internally, Apple will strive to increase minority representation in its workforce, Cook said. This has been a challenge for many tech companies, but Cook said the burden is on tech leadership to increase diversity.The idea is that an employee base that accurately represents society is better able to serve it. Apple is making a big bet that this will be good for business.", "DUBLIN, June 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The \"Global Laptop Market 2020-2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Hudson-based GT Advanced Technologies was under contract to produce screens for the phones, but Apple chose a different vendor after GT failed to meet specifications.A six-year-old lawsuit \u2014 filed in the ashes of the high-stakes failure of a New Hampshire tech company to manufacture iPhone screens \u2014 is winding down, after holdout defendant Apple Inc. recently agreed to pay $3.5 million to settle claims.A six-year-old lawsuit \u2014 filed in the ashes of the high-stakes failure of a New Hampshire tech company to manufacture iPhone screens \u2014 is winding down, after holdout defendant Apple Inc. recently agreed to pay $3.5 million to settle claims.The lawsuit stems from the 2013 partnership that Apple and GTAT forged to create a durable, scratch-resistant glass screen from synthetic sapphire for iPhones.In December 2013, GTAT raised some $300 million in stock offerings and corporate debt after announcing its deal with Apple. Nine months later, Apple released its latest iPhone without the sapphire screen, causing the value of GTAT stock and corporate debt to plummet.Within a month, bankruptcy followed, and investors eventually filed suit against GTAT\u2019s top executives, including former chief executive Thomas Gutierrez, Apple and investment banks involved in the securities transactions.\u201c(The) Lead Plaintiff in this case lost millions of dollars of hard-earned savings after investing in GTAT based on the company\u2019s statements that its deal with Apple was on track to be a great success, backed by Apple\u2019s considerable capital and expertise\u201d wrote Lauren A. Ormsbee, a New York lawyer who represented the investors, in an email.In November 2013, it announced the Apple deal. Apple would pay GTAT $578 million and provide a 1.3 million square-foot manufacturing facility in Arizona. Plans called for 2,000 GTAT furnaces to produce the sapphire.Gutierrez repeatedly ensured investors of progress in the Apple deal.Then in September, Apple unveiled its new iPhone 6 with screens made of Corning\u2019s ion-strengthened Gorilla Glass, not GTAT\u2019s sapphire screens. GTAT declared bankruptcy Oct. 6, 2014.The lawsuit said that GTAT executives later admitted they were out of options when they signed the Apple deal, that Apple dictated all the terms, and the agreement shifted all the risk to GTAT.And while company executives were touting the ability to create large crystal logs of sapphire, managers were warning them that they could not meet the demands in the Apple contract, filings read.An order by Judge Joseph Laplante quotes an unnamed GTAT sapphire product manager who said GTAT could not even produce a 165 kilogram log when it signed the Apple contract.The Apple contract called for sapphire logs of 262 kilograms, but GTAT began research into that benchmark only five days before the Apple deal was announced.Defendant lawyer Hershman said the management team devoted everything they had to the project and believed it would succeed. Apple remained committed to GT\u2019s sapphire glass until the day the company filed a strategic bankruptcy, he said.Apple was both surprised and disappointed.Judge Laplante rejected most claims against Apple. But in 2017 he agreed to hear testimony about the control that Apple had over GTAT, opening up the prospect of extended litigation for the California-based company.\u201cTo be sure, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of Apple\u2019s control are thin,\u201d Laplante wrote at the time. But it was enough to move forward, he said.Apple has countered by saying that it invested millions \u2014 the exact amount is redacted in court documents \u2014 in sapphire and would only do so expecting success.\u201cApple believed the project would lead to \u201can epic metamorphosis\u201d for both manufactured sapphire and mobile phones,\u201d Apple lawyers wrote in 2019.", "Apple Inc said on June 11 the iPhone maker will increase spending with black-owned suppliers as part of a $100 million racial equity and justice initiative, while Google's YouTube video service said it will spend $100 million to fund black content creators.

(https://reut.rs/37qJGk0)", "Last week, the world was gripped by the killing of George Floyd, and protests erupted around the world against police brutality and racism. Like everyone else, Apple stepped forward dutifully to offer words of support.In fact, Apple stepped forward in ways that many other companies have failed to do, going beyond nice tweets and affirming words to real action. Apple re-programmed its Apple Music content for an entire day in support of #blackoutTuesday, and announced a $100 million 'Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.' Whilst perhaps a small fraction of Apple's $1.4 trillion valuation, that's still a colossal amount of money. Yet last week, we noted that Apple needs to do even more to fight against social, political and racial in justice.Get an iPhone SE with Mint Mobile service for $30/moJust 7 days later, Apple and prolific video-conferencing platform Zoom have put themselves in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, namely censorship. Apple's decision to remove a popular podcasting app from its App Store in China and Zoom's outrageous treatment of pro-Chinese democracy advocates beg the same question: How long will we continue to turn a blind eye to censorship in tech?Apple put itself back in the censorship spotlight earlier this week, after podcasting platform Pocket Casts was removed from the Chinese App Store at the behest of the Cyberspace Administration of China. As per usual in these cases, the reason given was that Pocket Casts included \"content that is illegal in China.\" This is the exact same wording given to the developers of Plague Inc. and to the developers of the Quartz news app, both of whom also fell foul of Chinese censorship.In response Pocket Casts stated \"We believe podcasting is and should remain an open medium, free of government censorship. As such we won't be censoring podcast content at their request.\" It seems Pocket Casts was contacted by the CAC through Apple two days prior to its app being removed, and the timeline implies that was a request to censor some content on its platform, to which Pocket Casts said no.The issue is both simple and complex. There aren't many people who believe or agree that censorship is good, and its likely that Apple and Zoom don't feel that way either. Take for instance Zoom's response to this weeks events:Apple, like Zoom, is bound to local laws in the countries that it operates in. This same reasoning was behind controversial decisions made by Apple regarding changes to how Crimea and Sevastopol were displayed in its Maps software.Companies face the prospect of consequences from governments should they not comply with these sorts of requests. Apple relies heavily on China as part of its production base, and falling out of love with the Chinese government could lead to a swathe of far-reaching consequences for Apple, its device production and us, the consumer.The question is then, what is the right response to this? Obviously, agreeing to government censorship is probably the least ideal path to take in this predicament. But as we've noted, the consequences of refusing could be really damaging to companies. Should Apple or Zoom risk losing business, customers, or even the right to operate in countries by taking a stand against governments? Apple, for one, has never believe in a 'sideline' approach to these issues, and has always held that it can do more to affect change on issues from within, rather than from the outside. By way of example, Apple might well believe that it stands more chance of working towards a more preferable approach to censorship in China (or perhaps the end of censorship), if it remains within the government's good grace, perhaps in the same way that Tim Cook has cultivated a relationship with President Trump, despite their clearly different views on some matters.There is no easy answer, and I for one don't believe that the answer is the continued compliance with government requests. Yet it seems to me that companies like Apple risk over-stepping the boundaries with governments like China, sabotaging their chance to affect any change at all. And even if Apple were to turn around and refuse a request from China or Russia, how much impact would that actually have? Would it be enough to make entrenched political regimes think twice about censoring their citizens? I don't think it would.What do you think? Should companies like Apple and Zoom risk damaging their own businesses in a bid to push back against government censorship? Or is the political change required far beyond their scope of influence? How should a company like Apple respond to censorship, both governments requests and the wider issue?A recent rumor that Apple might drop the charger from its iPhone 12 boxes isn't actually a crazy idea.If you've been waiting for a killer Apple Arcade game, it might just have landed in the form of futuristic adventure game Beyond a Steel Sky.Apple's iconic rainbow logo has often been associated with the LGBT+ movement.

Nevertheless, it only increased their shareholding by a minuscule percentage, and it wasn't a massive purchase by absolute value, either. View our latest analysis for Apple Hospitality REIT Apple Hospitality REIT insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. They paid about US$13.10 on average. These transactions suggest that insiders have considered the current price attractive. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Apple Hospitality REIT insiders own about US$168m worth of shares (which is 6.7% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Apple Hospitality REIT. That's what I like to see! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we've found that Apple Hospitality REIT has 4 warning signs (1 is a bit concerning!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course Apple Hospitality REIT may not be the best stock to buy.

Last week, Apple announced the schedule for the event, confirming that it will kick off with the traditional keynote on Monday, June 22nd.So. Start your engines and let the speculation begin. What exactly will Apple be discussing in said keynote? Which announcements will they make? What rumors will immediately dissipate into dust?Of course, my Magic 8-Ball is only as good as any you can get from a toy store, so I can't tell you exactly what Apple's going to show off. But what I can tell you is what I want to see from the company. Here are a few of the things that I'm the most excited to hear about when Tim Cook steps into a virtual keynote in just seven short days.Was there any doubt that the rumored ARM transition is at the top of that list? Here's what I want to hear: that the company is finally ready to transition to its own custom-built processors, which will bring superior performance per watt, meaning both more powerful and, more importantly, more energy efficient Macs. It's 2020: time for a Mac laptop with all day battery life.The details are where it gets interesting. I think the top priority is for Apple to minimize disruption to developers. The company ably navigated transitions from 68k Motorola processors to PowerPC and then PowerPC to Intel, and while neither of those moves were without their hiccups, on the whole, they were pretty smooth.I hope\u00a0Apple brings its experience there to a similarly multiprong approach here. First, I hope (and fully expect) the company to say that porting most apps to the new architecture will be as simple as re-compiling in Xcode.During the PowerPC to Intel switch, Apple had Rosetta to help developers with the transition.Second, for the apps that may take more time and work to adapt to a new architecture, I'd hope to see a technology similar to the Rosetta translation layer that helped ease the shift to x86, so that existing Mac apps compiled can run on the new processors, even if that means a performance hit. Such a technology would be a placeholder, allowing users to keep running critical software until the developer can make a version native to Apple's new architecture.But I'd also hope that Apple will deem it time to finally rethink its approach to some longstanding features that have begun to feel a bit dated. For one, the Home screen. A grid of icons may have been acceptable back in 2007 when we we were all just trying to figure out how to use this amazing supercomputer that fit in our pocket, but after 13 years, I think we've got the hang of launching apps. Let's leverage Siri's Proactive intelligence features to surface stuff that we might need right on the screen where we use stuff the most. Or at least offer widgets like iPadOS (but better).Whatever macOS 10.16 is codenamed, it certainly has its work cut out for it. While this might seem like a good opportunity for a \"Snow Leopard\" style performance release, there are a number of places where Apple's older platform has fallen behind iOS, and I'd hope to see the company restore a little bit of that parity.As my colleague Jason Snell mentioned recently, Messages is in dire need of an update to bring it into line with its iOS counterpart. More recently, Apple added a Look Around Street View-like feature to Maps on iOS that the Mac version still lacks. Likewise, the Music, TV, and Podcasts app, designed with the first (and somewhat rudimentary) version of the Mac Catalyst technology, could all use updates. And Photos on the Mac has never felt as powerful as on iOS\u2014not to mention it desperately needs stability improvements.Overall, the Mac seems most in need of polish this time around, though Apple will no doubt have some new shiny features to convince people to make the upgrade. But let's hope that, as with iOS 14, stability is the name of the game. What good is a great new feature if you can't rely on the machine it's running on?Dan has been writing about all things Apple since 2006, when he first started contributing to the MacUser blog.

Commissions from the App Store, which is the only way developers can distribute apps to iPhones owned by consumers, have become a key sales driver for Apple as iPhone sales level off.But Apple\u2019s study suggested the App Store has a broader impact. The App Store generated $519 billion in billings and sales in 2019, according to the study, conducted by economic research consulting firm Analysis Group. Of that amount, $413 billion was from physical goods and services.Apple takes a commission of between 15% and 30% for digital goods and services purchased through the App Store. That practice has drawn antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, with rivals such as Spotify Technology Ltd saying the practice hurts their business.To avoid paying Apple\u2019s commissions, rivals like Spotify must ask their customers to sign up for subscriptions on their own website, which adds multiple extra steps compared with paying inside the App Store. Spotify has alleged that created an uneven playing field.In a conference call with journalists, Apple representatives said the company commissioned the study to gain a better understanding of the physical goods and services activity in its App Store.", "A new Market Research from Stats & Reports, the Global Digital Media Market 2019-25, is expected to show tremendous growth in the coming years.

The Wall Street Journal and other outlets did report that Apple is pushing back the production ramp up of its next iPhone.

This includes its services and wearables division, which surged 17% and 23%, respectively. Meanwhile, AAPL\u2019s adjusted earnings jumped 3.7%. Perhaps more importantly during these uncertain times, Apple closed the quarter with $83 billion in net cash. The tech titan also raised its dividend by 6%, with its yield resting at 0.98%, and it authorized a $50 billion increase to its stock buyback program.Apple\u2019s fiscal 2020 revenue it projected to climb nearly 1%, with its adjusted earnings set to jump 3.5%. Peeking further ahead, Apple\u2019s FY21 earnings consensus has climbed recently, with its adjusted FY21 EPS figure projected to jump 24% above our FY20 estimate on 14.5% higher sales. AAPL shares are up 15% in 2020 and it recently hit new all-time highs.

We\u2019re acutely aware of their power over us.Match Group continued: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of apps, including Internet behemoths that connect people (rideshare/gig apps), or monetize by selling advertising (social networks), have never been subject to Apple\u2019s payments systems and fees, and this is not right. We welcome the opportunity to discuss this with Apple and create an equitable distribution of fees across the entire App Store, as well as with interested parties in the EU and in the U.S.\u201dSeparately, The Verge reported Tuesday that the makers of a new email app called Hey, which launched Monday, received an unpleasant surprise when Apple reportedly threatened to remove the app from its App Store if it did not allow in-app subscriptions, which Apple would get a 30% cut from.In a series of tweets Tuesday, David Heinemeier Hansson, the founder of Basecamp, which made Hey, likened Apple to \u201cgangsters\u201d trying to shake him down. \u201cThis is profoundly, perversely abusive and unfair,\u201d he said.The makers of Hey maintain that since users can only sign up and pay for the service outside of Apple\u2019s iOS app, it shouldn\u2019t have to pay Apple a cut of its revenue.In an email to The Verge, Apple suggested it not doing anything out of the ordinary with Hey. Apple reportedly told Protocol that Hey should not have been approved in the first place, since Apple doesn\u2019t allow client apps \u2014 that is, where users can sign in but not sign up \u2014 for consumer services. For consumer apps, Apple reportedly told Protocol that it requires they offer feature in-app sign-ups and payments, so Apple can take a cut.While not commenting on specific cases, Apple told MarketWatch in an email Tuesday night that it requires developers to follow strict guidelines, and that its App Store guidelines clearly lay out its policy on in-app purchases. Apple said it is committed to offering a fair and level platform for developers.The complaints from the app makers come at a bad time for Apple, which earlier in the day found itself in the crosshairs of EU antitrust regulators, who announced they are investigating its Apple Pay service as well as its App Store. Complaints of unfair App Store restrictions from Spotify Technology SA         SPOT,          -0.94%       , among others, led to the EU probe.If found guilty, Apple could face a fine of 10% of its annual revenue.

It\u2019s our first look at the new operating systems that will ship to the public in the fall, and often a place where Apple unveils new hardware. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen Apple Music, the HomePod, the iMac Pro, and the Mac Pro announced at WWDC, in addition to new operating systems and updates to the current Macs.This year is a little different. COVID-19 has caused Apple to change WWDC into an online-only event and to hold it later in June than it typically does. Still, the week-long developer conference will be preceded by a streaming video Special Event, where we expect lots of big announcements.Here\u2019s a brief list of all the things we might see at this year\u2019s WWDC. With Apple, no matter what the rumors say, you never know what is going to be announced until the executives take the stage.More than anything else, WWDC is an event at which Apple will announce new operating systems and tell developers how to make apps that take advantage of their new features. Top of the list is iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 (the iPhone and iPad operating systems having gotten separate names last year).We don\u2019t yet know the name of macOS 10.16, the successor to macOS 10.15 Catalina. We\u2019ve heard fewer rumors about what to expect from macOS this year, but it seems likely that there will be major improvements to Catalyst, and some iOS-only apps (like Health and Activity) might make the leap to the Mac. Mac apps like Messages and Apple Music might become Catalyst apps, gaining feature parity with their mobile counterparts and perhaps significant interface changes.While iOS/iPadOS and macOS are Apple\u2019s biggest operating systems, Apple always has a few things in store for Apple TV and Apple Watch owners.Apple TV just got a huge overhaul with big features like multi-user support. This year we expect more interface tweaks\u2014especially as the Apple TV+ content grows.New watchOS features are often tied to new Apple Watch hardware, but additional developer interfaces and health features wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Apple has been moving toward making the Apple Watch more independent from the iPhone, with its own App Store, for example. There are still many ways in which the Apple Watch will not work if you don\u2019t have an iPhone, but watchOS 7 might give it that capability.Apple has dramatically increased its service offerings over the last few years, adding Apple News+, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade on top of Apple Music and iCloud storage plans.Perhaps Apple has a new service to announce? We haven\u2019t heard any rumors to that effect, but a non-hardware service offering may be easier to conceal than a new device or operating system update.We have heard rumors, however, of an Apple service bundle. We\u2019re not sure what services are included or what it would cost, but WWDC may be a good time to announce it, and we\u2019ve long-since believed that it would be a great idea.One of the biggest rumors about Apple\u2019s WWDC presentation is that the company will announce its intent to transition Macs from x86 Intel processors to ARM-based processors of its own design. Apple did a similar thing at WWDC in 2005, announcing the transition from PowerPC to Intel.This is a huge shift, and we probably shouldn\u2019t expect consumer products until next year. Rather, Apple will probably sell a special developer platform to registered developers, as it did in 2005. We have a more thorough examination of what the timeline and potential products could be.Recent rumors suggest that Apple is about to reveal an all-new iMac, fully redesigned and ready for the future. The new iMac supposedly takes its cues from the Pro Display XDR or iPad Pro, with thin bezels and and squared-off flat edges.The current iMac design has served Apple well, but it is way behind the times. This new design is just the thing to go with the coming processor transition, though it is not tied to it; the rumors say it will ship this year with an Intel processor and AMD graphics.Apple is supposedly working on a pair of high-end over-the-ear headphones. Reportedly called AirPods Studio, they would feature noise-cancelling, magnetically-attached band and cup padding, and premium sound.Apple is apparently working on a new Apple TV, essentially an upgrade from the current Apple TV 4K. It apparently will have an A12X or A12Z processor and double the storage (64GB or 128GB), but otherwise look similar to the current model.We\u2019ve heard about Apple\u2019s Tile-like trackers, supposedly called AirTags, for what seems like ages. Events come and go, and Apple never announces them.Will WWDC be the place where Apple finally takes the wraps off this not-so-secret product?Apple needs smarter HomePod software and a much less expensive hardware offering. Rumor has it that\u2019s on the way, though we don\u2019t know if it will be called HomePod mini, HomePod 2, or something else entirely.Apple is reported to be near the release of a couple new iPads. A new iPad Air would follow the design of the iPad Pro (thin bezels, flat sides, and Face ID) and a new iPad mini would grow in size to an over 8-inch display.Macworld is your best source for all things Apple.

Basecamp is best known as the developer of a popular team collaboration service of the same name. The controversy erupted on Tuesday after report in Protocol revealed that Apple had prevented Basecamp from rolling out an update containing bug fixes to its newly launched Hey iOS client.An Apple reviewer reportedly told the firm that the decision was made because Hey violated a section of its App Store guidelines that relates to payments. Specifically, the issue was that Hey allows iOS users to log into the app with a subscription bought elsewhere but doesn\u2019t provide a way for users to sign up for new accounts directly in the app interface. Apple permits\u00a0this practice for certain types of apps, but email services such as Hey are not allowed to implement it.Basecamp has accused Apple of being inconsistent in how it enforces its\u00a0policies. The firm pointed out other apps, including email services, that are allowed to be on the App Store even though they enable users to log into existing accounts but don\u2019t provide them with ability to sign up directly in the app interface.Apple has stuck by its stance. According to the Protocol report that detailed the Hey update rejection, Apple argued to the publication that\u00a0\u201cthe actual mistake was approving the app in the first place, when it didn\u2019t conform to its guidelines.\u201dWhether or not users buy an app subscription through an iOS app\u2019s interface is significant because Apple takes a 30% commission on all in-app payments. Some developers have complained to regulators about the\u00a0way the fee is applied.\u00a0The iPhone maker\u2019s rejection of the Hey update has attracted criticism\u00a0on Twitter from many media observers and tech industry figures. David Heinemeier Hansson, Basecamp\u2019s chief technology officer, wrote in a tweet that \u201cwe keep trying to find logic, consistency in Apple\u2019s App Store decisions. What\u2019s different about Fastmail? Why not Gmail? Outlook? But it\u2019s looking at the question the wrong way. The answer is much more basic: power. Apple can do what they want, when they want, so they do.\u201dHeinemeier Hansson directed even sharper criticism at the company in another tweet. \u201cThere is no chance in bloody hell that we\u2019re going to pay Apple\u2019s ransom,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will burn this house down myself, before I let gangsters like that spin it for spoils. This is profoundly, perversely abusive and unfair.\u201d\u00a0The timing of the controversy is significant because the European Commission on Tuesday opened two antitrust investigations into Apple. One of the probes seeks to determine whether Apple harmed competing apps through its\u00a0restrictions\u00a0around in-app payments. The other probe, which is likewise related to mobile payments, focuses on Apple Pay.\u00a0Apple is under fire after rejecting an update to email app Hey over App Store rulesApple is under fire after rejecting an update to email app Hey over App Store rulesForgot Password?", "The upcoming 5G cycle recently prompted Citi analysts to raise their price target on Apple Inc.

", "There are a number of market watchers and investors who think there is a real risk Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will see its iPhone sales decline year over year during its fiscal year 2016. A key element of this thesis is that Apple saw oversized growth in the preceding fiscal year thanks to the iPhone 6/6 Plus, which satisfied pent-up demand for larger-screen iPhones, according to FoolWith the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, Apple has introduced a number of key features and upgrades contrast to the hugely successful iPhone 6/6 Plus, respectively. However, there is still considerable debate as to whether these devices will be enough to really drive year-over-year iPhone revenue growth.I think Apple may have a proverbial ace up its sleeve to considerably boost the companys chances of posting another year of iPhone growth: the iPhone 7c.

According to the report, Apple is putting each set-up through its paces to see what works best.1) Apple will launch a couple of new iPhones in September 2016. This theory that Apple will push the launch forward to summer 2016 seems thin to us.2) We expect a 4.7-inch phone (called the iPhone 7), and a 5.5-inch model (the iPhone 7 Plus). If Apple does make another 4-inch iPhone (which, thanks to the success of the larger iPhones, is by no means a certainty) then we think itll be called something like the iPhone 7 mini.3) The iPhone 7 is likely to get a substantial physical redesign after the largely identical iPhone 6/6s generations. Its too early to know what direction Apple will pick, but its likely to be thinner than ever: putting the cut-down headphone socket patent into action would be one way to assist achieve this. Or even removing the headphone jack entirely, and forcing music fans to use wireless Bluetooth headphones, or headphones that connect via the Lightning port, or an adaptor.4) Higher screen resolution is a possibility  Apple undermined its own Retina is as sharp as your eyes can see myth with the iPhone 6 Plus, and the company is playing catchup against many of its rivals in terms of screen resolution. Apple may well take the higher pixel density that was exclusive to the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus (401 pixels per inch, as contrast to 326ppi for all non-Plus iPhones), and apply it to all the models in the next generation; it could even raise the pixel density further than this, although we fear that this is unlikely. And a harder screen material would play well, whether Apple manages to resurrect the sapphire situation or goes with Cornings new Project Phire.Apple usually keeps the same design for two generations of the iPhone (the 4 and 4s, say, or the 6 and 6s), before unveiling a physical redesign on the next update. We expect the iPhone 7 to be fundamentally different in look and design to the two generations of iPhone that precede it.Its possible that Apple will use different materials to make the iPhone 7 more durable. Before the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were unveiled there was speculation that Apple would use Sapphire glass for the display and Liquidmetal for the chassis, and two generations later APple may be ready to unveil one or both of these upgrades.Apple Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, education, and enterprise and government customers in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Rest of Asia Pacific.Apple Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, education, and enterprise and government customers in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Rest of Asia Pacific.Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), inclined 0.28% to $117.67, during its current trading session.Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), inclined 0.28% to $117.67, during its current trading session.", "Data Bridge Market Research offers a latest report on\u00a0Input Method Editor Software Market\u00a0Analysis and Forecast by delivering key insights and providing a competitive advantage to clients through a detailed report.

An acceleration of this trend is expected by many analysts as multinational companies and government authorities are investing billions of dollars in infrastructure development projects to create a platform to enable the growth of concepts like the internet of things.Apple can be expected to benefit from these favorable macroeconomic developments. At the same time, the company is diversifying into other business segments such as financial services and wearables to offset the decline in mobile handset device sales. As reported by Barron\u2019s, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva has identified five catalysts that could lift the share price to $400.Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), one of the major shareholders of Apple, has remained positive on the company's prospects ever since Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) first invested in 2016. According to company filings, Buffett\u2019s conglomerate is the second-largest shareholder of Apple, behind The Vanguard Group.In this analysis, Apple\u2019s prospects will be assessed along with its current valuation multiples to determine the best course of action for investors.First, Apple is planning to develop its own processors to be installed in Mac computers starting in 2021. The company is ditching Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), citing the chipmaker\u2019s inability to deliver on its long-promised 10 nm processors. The initiative to manufacture chips in-house will dramatically reduce the cost of manufacturing devices in the coming years. On the other hand, Apple will be less reliant on third-party vendors, which would make it possible to deliver on its promises regarding the launch of new products. In the past, the company has received backlash from consumers for postponing the introduction of promised features on time. The delay in bringing a 5G-enabled iPhone is a classic example of this.Second, Apple TV+ finally seems to be on the correct path to win consumers. The service, which was unveiled last November, failed to gain traction as competition from Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) proved to be difficult to combat. The key differentiator was the massive library of content of its closest rivals. To be truly competitive, Apple has decided to buy catalog content from other networks and studios. As reported by Bloomberg on May 19, the company is now open to producing films and TV series in partnership with renowned studios. These decisions will help the company improve the quality and quantity of Apple TV+ content, which could prove to be a game changer in helping it gain new subscribers. The video streaming industry is nowhere near a slowdown as Statista is projecting the sector will grow at a compounded annual rate of 10.1% through 2024.Third, Apple is actively pursuing growth opportunities in the health care industry in a bid to leverage its iPhone installed base of over a billion devices. The company has already launched multiple products and services to become a go-to solutions provider in the digital health care space. Below are some of these measures.Apple HealthThis open-source application development framework makes it possible for medical researchers to collect personal data of Apple users to improve the outcome of their studies.This platform allows users to track health conditions to identify potential risks early. For example, Corrie Health App, developed by Johns Hopkins University, helps Apple users monitor symptoms of a heart attack. The app sends out emergency notifications to chosen devices once the user is experiencing heart difficulties.Apple Health RecordsApple WatchAn in-house health clinic launched by Apple, which is open to its employees. If the experiment is successful, Apple might roll out this product to the public as well.The many initiatives taken by Apple to make a grand entry into the health care industry have gone unnoticed by the majority of investors. CEO Tim Cook confirmed in 2019 that Apple would no longer be a tech giant by 2025, but rather a services company that touches every aspect of human lives.Fourth, Apple introduced a low-cost iPhone in April that costs $399, which is a step forward in attracting new customers from important target markets such as India. Apple has historically proven to be a failure in India; its market share was negligible in the country in 2019. As illustrated below, the company was not among the top players in the Indian smartphone market.The new iPhone SE, released on April 20, is a reflection of this low-cost strategy. It will help Apple gain traction in underserved international markets. Amid the maturing nature of the U.S. smartphone industry, Apple seems to be doing the right thing by focusing on other high-growth regions to drive future earnings.The latest developments paint a positive picture for Apple\u2019s future, which is in line with Citigroup\u2019s expectations. However, a careful analysis of the valuation level is required to reach an investment decision.Although the prospects are promising, Apple is no longer trading at cheap multiples. According to data from Eikon, the closing share price of $352.08 on June 16 implies a forward price-earnings ratio of 27.71. In comparison, the five-year average multiple is 16.42. From a historical earnings multiple perspective, shares are significantly overvalued. A value investor with a low risk tolerance might not be comfortable initiating an investment in Apple at these prices.A growth investor, however, might still find Apple an attractive play considering the massive leeway for growth available as the tech giant makes inroads into other business sectors. The price-earnings ratio will decline dramatically if it can beat revenue estimates and improve earnings per share at a faster clip than analysts and investors are factoring into their models. According to company filings, it has ample liquidity with $94 billion in cash. This will prove to be a catalyst for growth as Apple can and will make the most of its financial strength to tap into new markets and business sectors. An investment in Apple will be a bet on the future of the company, which is quite uncertain at this points since it is in a transformation phase. If the transition to a business model with a focus on services is successful, Apple will reward investors handsomely for taking on the high risk.While Buffett seems to be comfortable holding Apple even after the massive surge in the share price over the last couple of years, Ariel Investments' Rupal Bhansali thinks the stock is overvalued. In an article published in January, I discussed why she thinks the best decision would be to short the stock. A closer look at the prospects and risks reveals Apple might still be a good investment for growth investors, but not so much for value investors as there is a significant degree of uncertainty involved.", "The Top players are Apple, Inc.

Unless antitrust regulators get in the way.\u00a0The European Commission cited unexpectedly quick adoption of mobile payments in its announcement yesterday of dual probes into Apple\u2019s power and potential anticompetitive behavior.\u00a0\u201cThis growth is accelerated by the coronavirus crisis, with increasing online payments and contactless payments in stores,\u201d the commission's vice president Margrethe Vestager said in a news release. \u201cIt is important that Apple's measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices.\u201dA sticker advertises Apple Pay as an accepted payment method at a restaurant \u00a0Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergMobile payment companies including PayPal have raised competition concerns about Apple Pay with regulators in the United States and Europe, according to a person familiar with matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to reporters.\u00a0The companies are concerned about Apple's restrictions on the presentation of rival payment options on its iPhones. Consumers for instance can add PayPal to mobile payment systems on Android or Samsung phones \u2013 but not Apple Pay. Apple also restricts developers' access to a chip that enables contactless payments, while Android phones, for instance, allow outside developers to access it.\u00a0In a news release, the European Commission said Apple dictates the terms to merchants who accept Apple Pay and limits the use of the wireless \u201cNFC\u201d chip on iPhones only to Apple\u2019s own service.\u00a0\u201cIt's disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don't want to play by the same rules as everyone else,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s right \u2014 we want to maintain a level playing field where anyone with determination and a great idea can succeed.\u201d\u201cAnd as we\u2019ve grown together, we\u2019ve continued to deliver innovative new services \u2014 like Apple Pay \u2014 that provide the very best customer experience while meeting \u00a0industry-leading standards for privacy and security,\u201d the company said.The pandemic could entrench Apple as a dominant player in contactless payments before startups and other payment rivals even have a chance to mount a serious challenge, said Tim Derdenger, who teaches at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business.However, the investigation is likely to be a lengthy process, which could ultimately result in fines or other changes to Apple's business if the bloc finds Apple behaved in an anti competitive manner.Apple has said little publicly about how the pandemic has affected usage of Apple Pay. In the company's earnings call that covered the second quarter of its 2020 fiscal year, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that grocers including Trader Joe's and Woolworth's were adopting the technology to serve customers safely, per a transcript. But analysts expect health concerns could accelerate the trend.\u00a0The European Commission is simultaneously probing the App Store. Rivals have blasted the company's practice of collecting a portion of subscriptions and other purchases, as my colleagues Reed Albergotti and Tony Romm reported yesterday. Some of the most prominent mobile app companies are taking their complaints public about Apple's grip on the iPhone.\u00a0The companies \u2014 Tinder parent Match Group and Fortnite owner Epic Games \u2014 each blasted Apple's long-standing policy on App Store sales, saying it has cut their profits and left consumers paying higher prices.Epic earns revenue from Fortnite players who are willing to pay real dollars for digital currency that can be redeemed for items in the game \u2014 and Apple takes a cut of those sales.\u00a0Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney told my colleagues security has nothing to do with Apple\u2019s \u201cextractive\u201d fees. \u201cThe iOS App Store\u2019s monopoly protects only Apple profit, not device security.\u201d\u201cApple is a partner, but also a dominant platform whose actions force the vast majority of consumers to pay more for third-party apps that Apple arbitrarily defines as \u201cdigital services,\u201d Match Group said in a statement, adding Apple \u201csqueezes industries like e-books, music and video streaming, cloud storage, gaming and online dating.\u201dMeanwhile, Basecamp's new Hey email service is taking its feud with Apple to Twitter, after the company rejected an update to its new app that fixed several bugs. Apple told the company it violated its policies by not using the Apple payments system. The developers didn't think that rule applied because people can't sign up or pay in iOS app. Now Basecamp chief technology officer David Heinemeier Hansson says the company risks being removed from the App Store, unless it gives Apple a cut of its sales:Wow. I'm literally stunned. Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY's ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue. Even worse: We're told that unless we comply, they'll REMOVE THE APP.Apple declined to comment, stating that it doesn't comment on specific app approvals.\u00a0Tech companies including Apple continue to be in the antitrust spotlight in Washington, as the House seeks to have chief executives from major tech companies testify as part of its year-long probe into the companies' behavior.\u00a0Apple has not yet explicitly agreed to send Cook to testify, even as Google, Facebook and Amazon have said that their chief executives are open to it, under certain conditions, Tony reports.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s a contentious rule limiting the amount of information available to app developers about payment options beyond the App Store.The European Commission launched an investigation into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s a contentious rule limiting the amount of information available to app developers about payment options beyond the App Store.Apple prohibits developers from including buttons, external links, or any other call to action, which directs customers other payment options other than in-app purchases. In particular, antitrust regulators are concerned that developers are forced to Apple\u2019s App Store payment service, which deducts most app subscriptions and in-app purchases.The complaint is not new but was renewed after Apple rejected app updates from Basecamp\u2019s newly launched subscription-based email app called \u201cHey.\u201d The email app allows subscribers to access its nouveau email service\u00a0across web, Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android but not via standard email protocols. Initially, Apple approved Hey iOS app before putting it on pause and limiting Basecamp from sending updates or bug fixes until it allowed users to subscribe to Hey\u2019s service through an in-app purchase.In a statement, the European Commission said Apple\u2019s competitors have been forced to either disable the in-app subscription possibility or increased their subscription fee in the 6the app and passed Apple\u2019s fee to consumers. In both cases, Apple did not allow developers to give alternative subscription possibilities outside of the app.There has been growing backlash against app stores run by Google and Apple, with many developers complaining about the high fees collected to access consumers\u2019 mobile devices. The European Commission is the first major regulator to launch an investigation into the matter formally. As opposed to Apple, Google\u2019s Android offers more choice for payment methods.\u00a0 Apple consumers can only use App Store to install apps on the iPhone, and in many cases, Apple deducts between 15% and 30% from developers offering the subscription. Many are not allowed to offer purchase options outside the App Store, a move that ensures that Apple gets the cut. Although some apps are allowed to function without a subscription bought through Apple, they cannot direct users to purchase the service outside of Apple\u2019s digital walls.", "\u201cA strong argument for the growth side is that the largest companies like Apple, Amazon, Google etc, have grown their earnings power to the point where on an operational basis, they generate so much cash and can finance anything they want to do with their stock, or by borrowing,\u201d said Yale Bock, founder of YH & C Investments in Las Vegas.

The Google-Apple app identified 99% of contacts on both platforms.

At the time, the jury came up with an award of more than $1 billion in damages, but that has since been whittled down to almost half the amount.Its been almost five years since Apple first accused Samsung of slavishly copying the iPhone, setting off a global patent battle that has shrunk in size but not in vitriol.

The firm attempted to release bug fixes shortly after the initial release but was informed by Apple that the update wasn\u2019t allowed to roll out because the Hey app violated the App Store guidelines. The decision proved highly controversial, drawing criticism from tech industry figures and media observers on Twitter and beyond.Apple said in a Thursday email to Basecamp shared with the press that the app violates the App Store guidelines. The issue is that Hey requires buying a paid subscription on an external website and doesn\u2019t provide a way to buy it directly in the app interface, which Apple generally prohibits. The iPhone maker makes exceptions for business software and so-called Reader apps that provide access to certain content such as music, but Hey doesn\u2019t fall into these categories.\u201cThe HEY Email app is marketed as an email app on the App Store, but when users download your app, it does not work,\u201d Apple\u2019s app review team wrote to Basecamp. \u201cUsers cannot use the app to access email or perform any useful function until after they go to the Basecamp website for Hey Email and purchase a license to use the HEY Email app. This violates the following App Store Review Guidelines.\u201dPhil Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of global marketing, echoed that point in a Thursday interview with TechCrunch. \u201cYou download the app and it doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s not what we want on the store,\u201d Schiller (pictured) was quoted as saying.\u00a0In the email to Basecamp, Apple suggested to the firm that it could bring Hey into compliance by creating a free version of the app with limited features and continuing to sell the subscription separately.\u00a0The fact that the rejection of the Hey update focuses on in-app purchases, or more precisely the lack thereof in the app, is an important element of the controversy. Apple recently became the subject of an antitrust probe\u00a0in the European Union because it allows developers to use only its own payment processing system for in-app purchases and takes a 30% commission. That commission was the reason cited by Basecamp for not providing an in-app subscription option inside the Hey app interface.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apple\u2019s stance sparked a discussion about App Store guidelines and their impact on developers. Congressman David Cicilline, the chair of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, likened Apple\u2019s in-app purchase fee to \u201chighway robbery.\u201d Others have criticized the tone of the letter in which Apple informed Basecamp of its decision.\u00a0Apple stands by controversial rejection of Hey email app updateAfter initial rebuff, UK turns to Google and Apple for COVID-19 contact tracing softwareApple stands by controversial rejection of Hey email app updateAfter initial rebuff, UK turns to Google and Apple for COVID-19 contact tracing softwareForgot Password?", "NEW YORK \u2014 Demand for safe havens rose and global equity markets turned south on Friday after Apple Inc said it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as coronavirus cases continue to rise, rekindling fears of a deadly second wave of the pandemic.NEW YORK \u2014 Demand for safe havens rose and global equity markets turned south on Friday after Apple Inc said it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as coronavirus cases continue to rise, rekindling fears of a deadly second wave of the pandemic.News of Apple\u2019s move involving stores in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and North Carolina doused hopes for a quick economic recovery that had spurred risk appetite earlier in the day, driving up European and U.S. stocks about 1%.Apple\u2019s decision portends more restrictions coming back as coronavirus cases increase and the reopening process stalls, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at currency brokerage OANDA.Stocks in Europe pared some gains but closed higher before the Apple news broke.

Another thing that\u2019s different this time is that everyone\u2019s talking about one thing that\u2019s more important than new iOS features: Apple\u2019s transition from Intel processors to ARM processors for its Macs.Rumors of this started a long time ago. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that in a couple of years Apple\u2019s going to use its indigenous ARM chips for Macs and ditch Intel altogether. Later that year, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo supported this rumor by his own prediction. In February, Kuo said ARM-based Macs are coming in 2021.So, we might not see any hardware announcements, but we\u2019ll see Apple making platform announcements, paving way for developers to move their apps to a new Mac architecture.Macs have existed for 36 years and there have been two transitions of processors till now. In the 90s, Apple switched from Motorola\u2019s 68k chips to IBM and Motorola\u2019s PowerPC processors. In 2005, Steve Jobs announced another transition to Intel\u2019s x86 processors. It\u2019s been more than a decade of Macs running Intel CPUs. But now Apple is prepared to move towards ARM to make laptops that are lighter and probably offer better battery life.Apple started to pave the road for the transition last year when it announced Project Catalyst. As a part of that, Apple provided a set of tools for developers to migrate their iPad apps to Mac, but it still requires some work to tweak the app. So these apps may share most of the codebase, but the final compiled binaries are different. I talked to a bunch of developers to find out how Apple expects to handle this transition.Peter Steinberger, the founder of PSPDFKit, said he expects Apple to announce ARM-based hardware in Q4, and that\u2019s when apps that share code with iOS will be able to share one binary file for their Mac counterparts:\u00a0I expect Apple to release ARM-based hardware in Q4, running macOS 10.16. Existing apps will keep working with a binary translator; they will enforce ARM binaries in September, and for most Mac apps it\u2019ll be easy to compile to ARM64. Apps that share code with iOS already compile to ARM, so that part should be easy.There\u2019s the question of transition hardware as well. There might be some rumors of an iPad being used as hardware for the shift. But, John Gruber has waved that possibility off on his blog. He said Apple sees iPads and Macs as different platforms, and iPads have only 6GB of RAM as compared to 8GB or more offered by Macs.Gruber believes Apple might release a Mac Mini or an iMac with ARM chips, and rent it to devs \u2014 just like they did in 2005. Or there might be a special reference Macbook in the offering.Noted developer Steve Troughton-Smith told me that he wants Apple to release an affordable and compact transition kit:I hope Apple\u2019s dev kit is cheap and accessible, because I know I\u2019ll want one! Last transition they built a desktop tower housing an Intel chip, but it\u2019s hard to imagine them going that route again this time \u2014 Apple\u2019s only just released its first desktop tower since 2012 after all, because it doesn\u2019t think people need that kind of form factor.\u00a0Steinberger said we\u2019ll likely get a remodeled Mac Mini, or if Apple is bold, they\u2019ll release a reference version Macbook Air or the 12-inch Macbook.\u00a0There are still some questions as to how Apple might handle some heavy-duty stuff. While simpler and relatively smaller apps might have an easy time moving from Intel to ARM, we don\u2019t know how Apple will handle the transition of apps such as Adobe Photoshop.In his blog, Gruber noted that virtualization software such as VMWare or Boot Camp utility that lets you run Windows on Macs might face problems running on ARM-based Macs. And even if Apple will provide an emulation mechanism the performance will not be up to the mark.Former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky noted that Apple might release a new compiler that will handle the transition.12/ So the question is really what app model/APIs will run on an ARM mac. Many believe Apple will simply release a new compiler that will take existing i86 apps and compile them to ARM. Boom. Magic. Apple has a new Mac with their own chips.He also believed large apps such as Adobe Premier or Microsoft Office will have to follow Apple\u2019s lead and \u201cExpress themselves\u201d through a Catalyst version. Sinofsky also suggested that it might take a long time for these apps to be ported to Macs with ARM architecture. And they should have an incentive to do it for a large userbase.Apple\u2019s potential move to ARM-architecture is exciting, but it won\u2019t be sudden and it won\u2019t come without its own cost. Microsoft has already tried this transition, and while they might not have a large developer base working on ARM-based apps, it\u2019s early days for the Seattle-based company.We might not see an ARM-based Mac for consumers right away. But at WWDC, Apple has an opportunity to set a framework that can ensure when consumers get one, everything is smooth and secure.You can follow all our coverage on WWDC 2020 here.", "Facebook Inc (FB) stock price is moving slightly up during the trading session.

Nevertheless, this shift in priorities hasn't hampered one-time sales, with App Store revenue has surged in recent quarters while wearables, like AirPods and the Apple Watch, continue to enjoy rising sales numbers. Still, the company has continued to struggle in finding another innovation quite like the iPhone, and sales of the product have fluctuated as of late.

Apple Inc. said it would re-close nearly a dozen stores across four states where cases of the coronavirus have climbed, showing wariness in the business community about the safety of reopening in some places.       Apple has taken a more conservative to store operations than other retailers. In mid-March, it was among the first to close its roughly 270 stores in the U.S., and upon reopening some stores in May, it required that staff and customers and staff wear masks and undergo temperature checks.       \"We take this step with an abundance of caution as we closely monitor the situation, and we look forward to having our teams and customers back as soon as possible,\" an Apple spokesman said in a statement. The company declined to comment further on the decision.       Apple's announcement weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the company's share price slipped 0.6% Friday.       Other retailers are likely to follow Apple in toggling operations on and off based on local data, said Jean-Emmanuel Biondi, principal in Deloitte Consulting's retail practice.       Apple was one of the first major U.S. retailers in mid-March to close its stores nationwide amid the pandemic. In reopened stores, Apple has required customers and employees to wear masks. The company also instituted other safety measures, including temperature checks at the door and social distancing inside.       Closing a handful of Apple stores will have limited impact on Apple sales.

Apple, which had yet to equip the iPhones with 5G modems had been accused by critics of having missed the network's early adoption in China.Now, Taiwanese publication DigiTimes is publicly reporting that Apple's model supplier Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) will proceed ahead with fabricating the Snapdragon X60 mmWave+sub6 5G modems that the publication speculates will power this year's iPhone refresh. Apple and Qualcomm's manufacturing partner TSMC (NYSE:TSM) (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation) will use its 5nm advanced manufacturing process capable of printing 171 million transistors-per-mm\u00b2 to build these chips.The big question on everyone's mind as we head towards the 2020 iPhone launch later this year is whether Apple will be able to avoid underselling the new gadgets post-launch. Post-outbreak economic conditions have injected the global and North American consumers with fiscal uncertainty, despite the fact that spending on products that enable working and studying from home has jumped.Apple, which has historically relied on high margins for the iPhone lineup has been caught smack in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak. The company's iPhone revenue dropped by roughly seven percent annually during its first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (FY2020) as they continued a trend also exhibited during 2Q19.Launching the iPhones with 5G will let Apple gain a leg up over its traditional competitor Samsung, whose high-end Galaxy S smartphone is powered by an older 7nm modem. Samsung already supports 5G networks through some of its high-end mobile gadgets, and as adoption rises and costs drop, it's natural that the Korean tech giant will bring 5G connectivity down to middle-tier gadgets as well.", "Social media were awash with black squares as every brand under the sun took part in #BlackOutTuesday in favour of the protests.

You enter the phone number you'd like deregistered from Google's Jibe/Chat/RCS messaging system, and that number is sent a verification code. (Note: that code gets sent whether or not you can even disable it for that phone number \u2014 just like Apple.) Once you enter your verification code, click/tap \"verify,\" and either your number will be deregistered or you'll get an error explaining how/why it can't be. For example: If it wasn't registered in the first place, or if your number is associated with a carrier's RCS system instead.Admittedly, I've run into\u00a0way fewer issues with missed messages switching from Android and RCS to iOS and iMessage than vice-versa. I'm still missing communications being sent incorrectly to iMessage to this very day following our iPhone SE review, and Apple claims my number isn't registered \u2014 what can you do. But for folks making the switch away from Google's Messages app and chat, you can now disable it without needing a spare compatible Android device around and an inconvenient SIM swap.", "List of few players are-:\u00a0\u00a0Airbus S.A.S.; Alphabet Inc.; CyberCity 3D, Inc.; BENTLEY SYSTEMS, INCORPORATED; Intermap Technologies; Mitsuibishi Electric Corporation; FLIGHT EVOLVED; Autodesk Inc.; Maxon Computer; Vricon; Trimble Inc.; The Foundry Visionmongers; Pixologic, Inc.; Dassault Syst\u00e8mes; Esri; Topcon; Adobe; Pix4D SA; Apple Inc.; Onionlab; NewTek Inc.; Saab AB; Occipital, Inc.; Golden Software, LLC; Applied EarthWorks, Inc.; Aerolion Technologies; Orbit GeoSpatial Technologies nv; Softree Technical Systems Inc.; Garmin Ltd. and TomTom International BV.List of few players are-:\u00a0\u00a0Airbus S.A.S.; Alphabet Inc.; CyberCity 3D, Inc.; BENTLEY SYSTEMS, INCORPORATED; Intermap Technologies; Mitsuibishi Electric Corporation; FLIGHT EVOLVED; Autodesk Inc.; Maxon Computer; Vricon; Trimble Inc.; The Foundry Visionmongers; Pixologic, Inc.; Dassault Syst\u00e8mes; Esri; Topcon; Adobe; Pix4D SA; Apple Inc.; Onionlab; NewTek Inc.; Saab AB; Occipital, Inc.; Golden Software, LLC; Applied EarthWorks, Inc.; Aerolion Technologies; Orbit GeoSpatial Technologies nv; Softree Technical Systems Inc.; Garmin Ltd. and TomTom International BV.", "Apple, Inc.", "Major Players in the global Mobile Health App market include: Johnson & Johnson Philips N.V.

Some of the group\u2019s anger was sparked by the rejection this week of a popular email app, and comes as Apple needs to sell developers on building apps for the company\u2019s latest platforms, including a wholesale shift of the underpinnings of the Mac.Hanging over the Worldwide Development Conference, which begins Monday, is the recent announcement by European regulators of an investigation that could fundamentally change the way Apple and developers make money from the App Store.The past week started with the Cupertino, California-based company touting that the App Store generated US$519 billion in revenue for the global economy last year. It ended with the rejection of the Hey email app, in part, because the developer won\u2019t give Apple a cut of the subscription revenue.\u201cWe thought Apple realized that developers made the platform, but this incident has explicitly made clear that Apple sees developers as a source of revenue only,\u201d said Aaron Vegh, a longtime software developer. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a difficult pill to swallow.\u201d He noted that the action of the past week would be front of mind at the conference.In a letter rejecting the latest software for the email app, Apple said the developer, Basecamp, hadn\u2019t created revenue for the App Store in eight years. \u201cIt reads as \u2018you have no value to us unless you\u2019re earning us tons of cash,\u2019\u201d Marc Edwards, an experienced App Store developer, wrote on Twitter. Apple generally requires developers to use its App Store payment service, which takes a cut of 15 per cent\u00a0to 30 per cent\u00a0of most app subscriptions and in-app purchases.Other developers said that Apple\u2019s slice of their revenue is the cost of doing business and they are happy to let the company handle app promotion and credit card processing. Some said the past week\u2019s events wouldn\u2019t affect their relationship. \u201cI\u2019ve had Apple capriciously reject my apps for over a decade now,\u201d David Barnard, developer advocate at RevenueCat, said. \u201cAt some point you just come to accept the fact that Apple is a for-profit company doing everything they can to maximize shareholder value.\u201dIn a statement, Apple said it \u201cdeveloped the App Store with two goals in mind: that it be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for entrepreneurs and developers. We\u2019re deeply proud of the countless developers who\u2019ve innovated and found success through our platform.\u201d The company added that 84 per cent\u00a0of apps are free and don\u2019t provide Apple a share of revenue.Apple\u2019s dealings with developers also are under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers. In an interview Friday on Bloomberg Television, Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, called the App Store policies \u201chighway robbery\u201d and said the company demands a \u201cransom\u201d from developers, referring to the 30 per cent\u00a0revenue share. He said the chief executive officers of the major technology companies including Apple would be asked to testify before Congress. Thus far, Apple has declined to make CEO Tim Cook available.Still, Apple needs the backing of the developer community for the changes expected to be unveiled at the conference.The company plans to announce a transition from Macs based on Intel Corp. chips to computers running its own processors. The shift will force developers to update their apps to support the hardware, which could be a lengthy process. Apple also wants the latest iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad software features to excite developers into building fresh apps for the devices.While the App Store generates revenue, its almost two million apps also give consumers reasons to buy Apple\u2019s hardware, which still make the company the vast majority of its money.Apple plans minor upgrades for the Apple TV set-top box\u2019s software with a new version of the hardware in the works for as soon as later this year, while the Apple Watch is expected to get new faces, a mode for kids and, most notably, a new sleep tracking app. Bloomberg News reported in 2019 that Apple expected to add sleep tracking to the Apple Watch this year.For the iPhone and iPad, Apple is expected to announce several new features, including the ability for the iPhone to serve as a car key, a new feature that works like Google Translate, upgraded tools for the developers to build augmented reality apps and updates to the Podcast service. Apple has also weighed opening up iOS further to third-party apps, letting users change their default mail app and web browser.Perhaps most important to iPhone and iPad users who quickly upgraded to iOS 13 last year, Apple has revamped its software testing process with plans to improve software quality and reduce bugs.The software updates will set the stage for a range of new hardware devices also launching this year, including a new Apple Watch, four redesigned iPhones, the new HomePod and Apple TV box, as well as updates to the iMac and MacBook Pro. The company also plans its first pair of over-ear headphones as well as an accessory for finding physical objects, which will integrate with the new software.For Apple engineers, putting together this coming week\u2019s conference has been a challenge. COVID-19 related precautions have made the event Apple\u2019s first to be held wholly online and most engineers developed their products and planned the gathering from their homes.5G will initially be 'a disappointment' for Apple: Loup Ventures' Gene MunsterApple said to be readying for autumn launch of Apple TV+ at US$9.99 per month", "Apple has grand ambitions to move into the health care field. The company's CEO Tim Cook once referred to health as the company's \"greatest contribution to mankind.\"But with a concrete strategy and a biomedical breakthrough, such as non-invasive blood pressure or blood sugar monitoring, it could do a lot more. Ahead of its World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) next week, here's what people in the health and technology sector think of Apple's influence and achievements so far -- and where it needs to go next.\u00a0Apple has a slew of products and services in health care.Its primary product is the Apple Watch, and health is both a major use case and selling point. Its smartwatch device offers activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, an electrocardiogram to detect irregularities with the heart's rhythm, fall detection alerts, integrations with third-party health apps, and more.\u00a0The Apple Watch has other benefits, but overall, \"the greatest use case for Apple Watch still remains health,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst\u00a0with Creative Strategies specializing in consumer technology.\u00a0Henrik Berggren, founder of a diabetes-focused virtual medical clinic called Steady Health, said the Apple Watch is most helpful when it comes to tracking exercise and incorporating data from existing blood-sugar tracking devices. Many of Steady Health's patients already have Apple Watches or iPhones, and the group will look at that data in addition to their blood glucose levels and eating habits. \"That exercise part they're doing quite well today,\" he says.\u00a0Beyond the Watch, vice president of technology Kevin Lynch is working to let customers bring medical information, including lab results and medical history, to their iPhones. That software, known as Apple Health Records, is continuing to make strides, but is still held back by the fact that consumers have to remember which doctors and hospitals they've been to in recent years and log into those systems separately.\u00a0Internally, Apple's California-based employees can use a health-care system known as\u00a0AC Wellness. The company doesn't speak about it much and hasn't said whether it plans to expand those clinics to consumers more broadly. For now, it likely functions as a way for the health teams to learn about the practice of delivering medicine - and not just building tech.\u00a0During the Covid-19 pandemic, Apple teamed up with Google to release contact tracing technology for mobile phones, which public health researchers can use to build apps to track exposure to the virus. The company has seen the most traction for that in Europe and Asia.\u00a0Doctors have mixed feelings about the role of consumer health devices, including Apple's.When John Koetsier, a technology consultant and writer, tried to share his Apple Watch data with a doctor, he was essentially told to keep it to himself. Koetsier had been tracking his food intake, weight and exercise on his own. But his doctor said that he had too many information sources already, and was feeling overwhelmed.\u00a0\"I trust Apple's step tracking, but heart rate I'm more concerned about,\" said Dr. Josh Emdur, a telemedicine doctor with SteadyMD. Emdur said he once admitted a patient into the hospital a few years ago because of an Apple Watch result, but it turned out to be a false alarm. He acknowledges that the data seems to have improved since then, and he's now using Apple Watches as a heart health screening tool. But he'll still recommend a medical device, like a Zio cardiac monitor, as a followup.\u00a0\"To make the use- generated data actionable from devices like the Apple Watch, it needs to integrate better with electronic health record dashboard so a care team can see trends and it all comes in in a structured way,\" he said.New York-based cardiologist Dr. Jeffrey Wessler says the Apple Watch offers more benefits than harms. \"It really was a catalyst for the industry because it was the first time a consumer device began to infiltrate the clinical environment in a high volume way,\" said Wessler, who runs preventative heart health clinics called Heartbeat. \"But he notes that it can be frustrating patients come in with a concerning Apple Watch reading but no risk factors. In that case, there might not be a clear treatment pathway, and they're simply sent back home and told to come in if they develop symptoms.Apple could make money in health by using it as a way to market and sell more of its devices. But there are much bigger opportunities in the $3.5 trillion health care sector.The company has already announced partnerships with insurers, like Aetna, where users can \"earn off\" the cost of a device by engaging in healthy behaviors. It's also talking to some private Medicare plans about subsidizing the cost of the device for seniors.Another game-changer would be if Apple can introduce more sophisticated sensors, including non-invasive glucose or blood sugar monitoring or a blood-pressure monitor. At that point, its device could reach a much bigger market -- 6 in 10 Americans - with one or more chronic diseases, as well as prevention. \u00a0More than 1 in 3 Americans, for instance, are at high risk for type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\"I think there's a lot of opportunity for Apple still in the space,\" said Bajarin. \"For me, it's really hinges on preventative health (as) that really expands the potential of the Apple Watch.\"Other experts suggested the following areas where Apple should go next:Telemedicine: Wessler, the cardiologist, believes that there needs to be an intermediary layer that helps triage patients. Instead of rushing to the emergency room or to a specialist, Apple could direct patients to an online visit and even offer its own video-based online medicine service.More interoperability and integration with other medical devices: Apple already has close relationships with companies like Dexcom in the diabetes space, but the doctors agreed that it would be helpful to expand on that.\u00a0More validated clinical trials\u00a0would give Emdur, the telemedicine doctor, more confidence about the medical features in its products, including arrhythmia detection. Apple has done some trials, but it could double down.\u00a0Food logging: Helping people track the nutritional content of their food is another opportunity. Imagine snapping a picture of the food and algorithms figure out what's in the food. \"It's a really hard problem but if anyone could solve it, that would probably be Apple,\" said Berggren.\u00a0Apple Pay integrations: Apple could use its expertise in payments to help people navigate their health care bills.\u00a0More health features in Airpods: For Bajarin from Creative Strategies, that's an obvious move. It's easier to measure some vitals from the ear, which could make it a powerful health-focused wearable.\u00a0What's on your Apple Health wishlist? Let us know at @CNBCTech.", "FOX Business' Susan Li on Apple and Google's new contact tracing technology. For most of the past decade, the story of\u00a0Apple\u00a0Inc. has been the story of the iPhone. Yet in that time, Apple has learned a neat trick: how to get roughly 1 billion iPhone owners to fork over money for a strategically expanding number of non-iPhone products and services.This diversified moneymaking approach is crucial because there are fewer and fewer people on Planet Earth who have yet to buy into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, but still want and can afford its products.Of course, Apple will continue looking for new iPhone buyers and, as Chief Executive Tim Cook has often\u00a0signaled, it will eventually need\u00a0a successor to the iPhone. Meanwhile, Apple will also have to stay on the right side of regulators, and its own developer partners, even as it grows ever larger.The number of people buying their first new iPhone has declined every year since its peak in 2016, when there were 129 million of them, according to calculations by independent Apple analyst Neil Cybart. In 2019, the number was 48 million, and it continues to decline. Yet during last holiday season Apple experienced record-high quarterly revenue.CORONAVIRUS SPIKES PROMPT APPLE TO RE-CLOSE STORES IN FLORIDA, ARIZONA, CAROLINASThis can be explained in two stats. First, quarter after quarter, Apple continues to report increasing growth in services revenue, which hit $13.3 billion\u2014or 23% of its total revenue\u2014in the quarter ending March 28. This includes iCloud, Apple Music and TV subscriptions, commissions on app sales, payment from Google to be Safari\u2019s default search engine, and the like.This is money Apple makes from people using devices, not buying them. On the eve of Apple\u2019s yearly Worldwide Developers Conference, which the company is holding as an entirely virtual event for the first time next week, Apple\u2019s lucrative relationship with its developer community has never been more vital\u2014or more tempestuous.APPLE APP STORE SUPPORTED $519B IN ONLINE COMMERCE IN 2019With a cratered global economy, fewer people might be buying phones, says Patrick Moorhead, president of the technology research firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple noted in its last earnings call that people are already holding on to their iPhones a bit longer, and the company has for some time been using\u00a0lower prices\u00a0to convince its customers to upgrade.A customer compares her iPhone 6, left, with an iPhone 7 at an Apple Store in Chicago. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File)Analysts at Goldman Sachs have projected that those who do buy iPhones will likely go for the cheaper models,\u00a0further depressing\u00a0the all-important average price of an iPhone sold by Apple. That blow could be softened as long as everyone with an iPhone keeps spending on other things: All those AirPods and Apple Music subscriptions\u2014especially because Apple\u2019s accessories and services have larger profit margins than its high-end hardware.The second stat explaining Apple\u2019s continued growth is the number of active Apple devices in the world. Every year, that number goes up by about 100 million. These include iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, Apple TV boxes, and even the poorly selling HomePod speakers, but not AirPods, which can\u2019t independently connect to the internet. In 2016, there were a billion active Apple devices. Now, Apple reports 1.5 billion. About two-thirds are iPhones, says Mr. Cybart.APPLE, GOOGLE RELEASE CORONAVIRUS CONTACT-TRACING TECHNOLOGY FOR APPSOf approximately 1 billion iPhone users, roughly half own only an iPhone and no other Apple devices, estimates Mr. Cybart. This group of people, often recent iPhone owners outside the U.S., represent fertile ground for Apple to continue growing its services revenue and sales of non-iPhone devices.In Apple\u2019s most recent earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that the company sold $6.3 billion worth of \u201cwearables, home and accessories\u201d\u2014which include AirPods, the Watch and HomePod\u2014and that 75% of Watch sales that quarter were to first-time buyers. Apple has said this category by itself is now as big as \u201ca Fortune 140 company,\u201d which would mean it generates around $22.5 billion in revenue a year.In this Feb. 26, 2020, photo, a worker polishes iPhones in an Apple store in Beijing. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)Getting iPhone owners to buy bigger-ticket Apple products\u2014for instance, a laptop\u2014requires Apple to do something it hasn\u2019t in a long while: prioritize the Mac. In the PC market, Apple \u201chasn\u2019t really gained any market share since the MacBook Air,\u201d says Mr. Moorhead.If, at this year\u2019s WWDC, Apple announces that it is moving some of its MacBooks onto\u00a0its own ARM-powered chips\u00a0and away from\u00a0Intel\u2019s, it could be a way Apple uses vertical integration to make its notebooks\u00a0more attractive\u00a0to potential switchers from Windows.By saving money on the central processor\u2014Mr. Moorhead estimates that could mean $150 a notebook\u2014Apple could add features such as cellular connectivity, enhanced graphics, or even novel sensors and processors now found only in iPhones. Apple could also give these notebooks the ability to run a\u00a0vast library of existing iPad apps. Apple might finally get above its roughly 7% share of global PC sales, says Mr. Moorhead.BRITAIN SCRAPS VIRUS TRACING APP FOR APPLE-GOOGLE SYSTEMAnother lever Apple can pull with its most dedicated iPhone owners is an offer to finance the purchase of its products. On June 15, the company announced 0% financing for Apple products\u2014if they\u2019re purchased with an Apple credit card. (Any fees incurred would also drive up Apple\u2019s services revenue, of course.)While the company won\u2019t admit it, it behaves like it knows its pool of new customers is thinning. Take the iPhone SE, launched in mid-April. It costs half what a new iPhone typically costs but has some of the internals of Apple\u2019s latest models. It is aimed at\u00a0new customers in emerging markets, though it could also attract those iPhone owners who have been reluctant to upgrade.A flat lay image of the iPhone 11 Max and Apple Watch Series 5 (Kurt the Cyber Guy / cyberguy.com)Before the current economic shock, the global middle class was set to grow by 160 million people a year through 2030,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution. Over three billion people already qualify, with geographically adjusted incomes between $11 and $110 a day. Most can\u2019t afford Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone 11, which starts at $700, much less its $1,450 top-of-the-line model. In India, for example, the average smartphone\u00a0goes for $180. The $400 iPhone SE isn\u2019t that cheap, but it might be more affordable to tens of millions more people.The biggest liability of Apple\u2019s current strategy is that even though the company is now less reliant on making money from the sale of every iPhone, the iPhone is still at the core. If the iPhone should lose market share, the engine of Apple\u2019s success could sputter to a halt, or even be thrown into reverse. This could happen either because it is disrupted by\u00a0some new technology\u00a0from a competitor, or because millions of people can no longer afford the iPhone on account of the global economy, even at the price of an SE.Apple\u2019s evolving business model presents another potentially critical vulnerability: A growing list of opponents\u2014including European Union regulators and tech companies like Spotify Technology SA, Tile Inc. and Basecamp LLC\u2014are claiming Apple uses its dominance to charge unfair prices and\u00a0suppress competitors. While Apple never dominated global smartphone market share, it does dominate its own device ecosystem. The more Apple tries to drive growth by leveraging it, the more abusive it could appear.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don\u2019t want to play by the same rules as everyone else,\u201d Apple said in a recent statement. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply proud of the countless developers who\u2019ve innovated and found success through our platform.\u201dApple further\u00a0defends itself\u00a0against claims that it abuses its tight control over its own platform by insisting that it can hardly be a monopoly when Android has the\u00a0lion\u2019s share\u00a0of the global smartphone market. It has also recently trumpeted that the App Store has made possible more than\u00a0half a trillion dollars\u00a0of sales and subscriptions for companies other than Apple. Finally, the company has pointed out that 84% of the apps on its App Store pay Apple nothing.Even at its enormous size, Apple\u00a0has figured out how\u00a0to continue to grow, by vertically integrating,\u00a0tempting us with more\u00a0devices, accessories and apps, and selling lots and lots of phones, albeit at a lower margin. But it can\u2019t do it alone: The golden goose depends on the cooperation of software and content partners, regulators\u2014and more than a billion loyal customers.", "The main U.S. indexes ended the week higher, led by the Nasdaq's 3.7% gain.

Joni Ive, the company\u2019s chief designer, objected to some fundamental aspects of Rockwell\u2019s product, Bloomberg reports.For several years, a team of 1000 engineers by Mike Rockwell has been striving to create the biggest hits of the company since the iPhone. At the end of 2018, Apple Inc. planned to create a powerful headset with the capabilities of both virtual and augmented reality, when the situation changed dramatically. Joni Ive, the company\u2019s chief designer, objected to some fundamental aspects of Rockwell\u2019s product, Bloomberg reports.AR and VR headsets were supposed to be the first major release of the company since the time of Apple Watch and the debut device from Technology Development Group. This is a secret division of the company dedicated to the development of VR and AR. TDG is led by CEO Mike Rockwell. After working at Dolby Laboratories Inc. and Avid Technology Inc., Rockwell, 53, was hired by Dan Riccio, Apple\u2019s chief technology officer, in 2015.Ive did not agree with the prospect of selling a headset that would require a separate stationary device for full functionality. He encouraged Rockwell and his team to rebuild the N301 for less powerful technology, but which can be fully integrated into the device. Rockwell did not agree, arguing that the wireless hub would provide such high performance that Apple would push everything else out of the market. The confrontation lasted for months.The N301 prototypes look like a smaller version of Oculus Quest, a Facebook Inc. VR headset, with a mostly fabric body but less plastic than Quest. Apple engineering teams are still testing the device on different head shapes to figure out the perfect fit. The company has not yet decided on prices. In comparison, Oculus Quest sells for $ 399. Microsoft sells Hololens 2 mixed-reality headsets and Magic Leap AR glasses for $ 3,500 and $ 2,295, respectively.The N301 will have its own App Store with a focus on games and the ability to stream video content. It will also become a kind of ultra-modern communication device for virtual meetings. Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, will manage both the headset and possible points. Although it is also tested using a physical remote control. Apple has reassigned some of the engineers who worked on the Siri interface to Rockwell\u2019s team.Apple plans to announce new tools for iPhone AR applications at its annual developer conference this month. Although plans could change, at a meeting last fall, Rockwell said the first headset could be announced next year and released in 2022.

A big bite. It didn't take very long for Apple to become the single-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio.He became such a huge fan of Apple that he has referred to it as Berkshire Hathaway's \"third-largest business.\" Buffett stated in an interview with CNBC earlier this year that Apple is \"probably the best business I know in the world.\" Apple has been a big winner for Buffett since 2016. It's also been one of the legendary investors' few winners so far this year, racking up a gain close to 20%.However, Buffett didn't take the lead with Berkshire's investment in Amazon as he did with Apple. Even before a regulatory filing in May 2019 revealed that Berkshire had invested in Amazon, Buffett stated in an interview that one of his investment managers had initiated the purchase. He acknowledged, though, that he had \"been a fan\" of Amazon for a while and had \"been an idiot for not buying it.\"It's easy to examine the performances of the stocks in Berkshire's holdings to see how Amazon and Apple stack up against the rest. What's not so evident, at least on the surface, is how important the two stocks have been this year in driving the stock market higher.The S&P 500 index is weighted by market cap, with larger companies carrying greater weight in the index.\u00a0As two of the three biggest companies in the world, Amazon and Apple together make up more than 9% of the S&P 500.Just how much do Amazon and Apple carry the stock market on their shoulders? The S&P 500 is down around 5% year to date. Without the big gains by these two giant tech stocks, the index would be down around 8%. Just two stocks have caused the S&P's year-to-date loss to close to half of what it would have been otherwise.The top five companies in the S&P 500 -- add Microsoft, Facebook, and Alphabet to the mix, along with Amazon and Apple -- make up around one-fifth of the entire market cap of the index. Combined, the stocks of these companies have pushed the S&P 500 up by a little under 5% this year.Amazon, Apple, and their technology peers seem likely to keep up their winning ways.

The chips will be manufactured by Apple itself, following in the footsteps of its iPhone and iPad devices, ostensibly giving the company enhanced control over its hardware.The shift to Arm-based chips is a monumental one for Apple and its biggest shift in architecture since Steve Jobs announced in 2005 that Apple was planning to switch from PowerPC-based processors to Intel. Notably,\u00a0though the announcement of the switch came in the June of that year at WWDC 2005, the first two computers were not announced by Jobs until the following January.It\u2019s possible history could repeat here, since Apple will want to give developers time to adapt to the new architecture before Arm-powered Mac are available to the public.Various reports have suggested that the first Arm-powered Macs will launch in 2021 with the first chip a 12-core model. The chip is believed to include\u00a0eight high-performance cores and at least four energy-efficient cores\u00a0that sacrifice some computing capacity for a lower\u00a0power draw.The main draw at WWDC 2020 is the latest updates to Apple\u2019s range of software. Expected to be announced at the event are iOS 14 and the related iPad OS 14, along with macOS 10.16, watchOS 7 and tvOS 14.Leading the pack will be iOS 14 which is expected to offer a range of enhanced accessibility and gestures along with a new app draw, wallpaper features and Homekit upgrades. One of the biggest updates rumored to the coming to the new version of iOS is a new augmented reality app. According to one report, the AR app will enable users to view information about items on store shelves and other objects by pointing their phone\u2019s camera at them.iPadOS 14, which is basically iOS 14 but customized for iPads, is also expected to get the new augmented reality feature. iPad specific additions could include enhanced Apple Pencil support for websites and some other tweaks to enhance productivity on larger screens.WatchOS 7 is expected to offer new faces, a mode for kids and a new sleeping tracking app,\u00a0according to Bloomberg, while tvOS 14 is expected to deliver minor tweaks including a kids mode as well.Although\u00a0Apple may be switching to Arm-architecture, that doesn\u2019t preclude the company announcing updates to exiting Intel-powered hardware and a strong report has Apple announcing a new iMac. The all-in-one computer hasn\u2019t had a serious refresh in years, so Apple is expected to give the computer a complete\u00a0design overhaul.Where the rumors become confusing is that renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is predicting that the new iMac could actually be Arm-powered and may debut alongside an Arm-powered 13.3-inch MacBook Pro.Also rumored to be making its debut at WWDC is HomePod 2, Apple\u2019s first update to its smart home speaker. The original HomePod made its debut at WWDC 2017 and though it has\u00a0received various software and feature updates since that time, it\u2019s getting a little long in the tooth.WWDC 2020 can be watched online starting at 10 a.m. PDT Monday, topped by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook (pictured), via Apple\u2019s Special Events website, the Apple Developer App, Apple TV app, a YouTube stream and, surprisingly, on four mainland Chinese services:\u00a0\u00a0Tencent,\u00a0iQIYI,\u00a0Bilibili\u00a0and\u00a0Youku.Arm-based Macs, new HomePod: Here's what to expect from Apple's online-only WWDCArm-based Macs, new HomePod: Here's what to expect from Apple's online-only WWDCForgot Password?", "Apple has just succeeded the 2018 iPad Pro with 2020 models in two sizes: 11-inch and 12.9-inch. Of the two, I\u2019ve been working with the 12.9-inch, along with its magical accessory, the Magic Keyboard which makes it more laptop-like than ever. The 11-inch tablet is more suited to \u2018lean-back\u2019 activities like reclining on a stack of cushions to read while the 12.9-inch is better for \u2018lean-forward\u2019 work. But both can be used for either and both make for great travel gear \u2014 for when we resume travel. Also, other accessories available such as the Apple Pencil, a mouse, a keyboard, external storage, and extra large trackpad can all transform what you do with the iPad Pro, no matter which of the two sizes fits your life better. A lot of the functionality of the iPad Pro also comes from the evolution of iPadOS which now makes it possible to use it for multitasking and productivity on the go. The 2020 iPad Pro looks almost identical to the 2018 version. If you don\u2019t glance at the back, you could get the two mixed up. They both can use the new Magic Keyboard and the old Smart Keyboard \u2014 as well as other Bluetooth keyboard from a third party though that may take away from the functionality and experience. Everything on the front including the screen itself looks the same \u2014 and of course, they both use the newest release of operating system from Apple so that makes them behave the same. A new feature on the iPad Pro 2020 is a LIDAR scanner. Light Detection and Ranging is a way of measuring distance by illuminating a target with laser light and measuring the reflection with a sensor. On the iPad, it\u2019s meant to make Augmented Reality smoother and more realistic, making the movement of an object over others more natural, for example, instead of looking artificial and struggling to form. This is quite possibly a hardware addition we will see on other Apple products in the future since Apple really has some stupendous AR applications. The new iPad Pro uses a chip Apple calls the A12Z Bionic. It isn\u2019t experienced as being different front he 2018 iPad Pro actually, and that may be the problem with machines that are really powerful to begin with. The processor certainly makes it the most powerful consumer tablet in the world, able to handle tasks such as video editing and image rendering and using the Pencil with no lag at all. The screen is as brilliant as ever, the sound excellent, and I expect it\u2019s not about to slow down much as the previous iPad Pro versions haven\u2019t.

He said the conversations helped his company avoid mistakes that could have cost thousands of customers and millions of dollars.       This year, Mr. Case will be attending Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, which begins Monday, from his home in Seattle. Because of the coronavirus crisis, Apple is hosting the event entirely online for the first time since it was first held more than three decades ago. Mr. Case said he will miss the meals and serendipitous meetings that usually fill a week in California annually.       \"There's a value in meeting strangers, and that doesn't happen virtually, \" said Mr. Case, whose company makes productivity software for Apple products.

In recent years these events have grown in scale and glitz, and include Microsoft Corp.'s Build, Salesforce.com Inc.'s Dreamforce and Amazon.com Inc.'s AWS re:Invent. About two dozen of the conferences are held annually, drawing more than a million in-person attendees combined.       Apple's event has taken on added importance in recent years as it has looked to offset slowing iPhone sales with rising sales of software and services. The event drew 6,000 attendees last year, and the city of San Jose, Calif., estimated the loss of the in-person event cost it $9 million in economic activity.       Apple hopes to maintain the conference's sizzle online. It brought film crews to its corporate campus in early June to record videos of its engineers' training sessions, according to people familiar with its preparations. Apple declined to comment on the videos but has said publicly it is offering virtual, one-on-one sessions for developers with its engineers. It eliminated its fee for participants, which was $1,599 last year.       Apple usually hosts a software showcase on the first day of its Worldwide Developers Conference. It is expected to announce its plans to introduce Macs next year with processors designed in-house instead of processors from Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. The transition was earlier reported by Bloomberg. ", "On Monday, Apple Inc.

It would also create a lot of work for developers, who would have to update coding to remain compatible.Some expect a new Apple TV more compatible with a 4K model, a HomePod 2 or HomePod Mini, and a redesigned iMac with an AMD Navi GPU, a T2 chip, all-flash storage and thinner bezels.Given Apple\u2019s shift from Beats to in-house hearables like AirPods, analysts consider over-the-ear headphones a near-term probability.\u201cApple could ride the momentum behind the AirPods brand and tap into consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more on headphones,\u201d Munster wrote. \u201cIn terms of revenue, this product would likely not move the needle for Apple.\u201dAdditionally, analysts have long anticipated the reveal of Tile-like Bluetooth trackers.

Bloomberg/Kiyoshi Ota                         Apple Inc. will start removing thousands of mobile games lacking government approval from its App Store in China next month, closing a loophole that the likes of Rockstar Games have relied on for years.Apple Inc. will start removing thousands of mobile games lacking government approval from its App Store in China next month, closing a loophole that the likes of Rockstar Games have relied on for years.This has until now allowed games such as Grand Theft Auto, whose gory depictions of violence are unlikely to ever pass muster with Chinese censors, to be available within the country\u2019s borders. China\u2019s regulators require all games that are either paid or offer in-app purchases to submit for review and obtain a license before publication, and major Android app stores have enforced such rules since 2016. But unapproved games have flourished on Apple\u2019s iPhone platform.It\u2019s unclear why Apple -- a target of numerous regulatory clampdowns in the past -- hasn\u2019t moved as swiftly as other app stores in China, which are owned and operated by local mobile giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp.The latest approvals process took effect in 2019 amid confusion among industry players about the speed with which Beijing, known for months-long content reviews that may or may not lead to a monetization license, would process requests. For its part, Apple has begun ramping up oversight of its Chinese app store, removing two podcast apps earlier this month at China\u2019s request.Back in February, Apple reminded iOS developers in the country to obtain licenses for their titles by June 30. But it was only after prolonged uncertainty about enforcement that the iPhone maker explicitly told publishers that any unlicensed games after the deadline will be banned and removed from the local App Store, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is not public.There\u2019s no telling how long it will take to remove all unlicensed games once the change comes into effect. Chinese gaming blog Gamelook earlier reported Apple\u2019s upcoming enforcement.An Apple representative declined to comment.China accounted for about a fifth of the $61 billion in digital goods and services sold via Apple\u2019s App Store in 2019, making it the largest market after the U.S., the Analysis Group estimates. Apple takes a 30% cut from the majority of such transactions.Apple\u2019s new effort highlights the Chinese government\u2019s tightening grip on gaming. Citing concerns about the proliferation of addiction among minors and the dissemination of offensive content, regulators now adopt a much stricter and slower review process than before they temporarily halted all approvals in 2018.5G will initially be 'a disappointment' for Apple: Loup Ventures' Gene MunsterApple said to be readying for autumn launch of Apple TV+ at US$9.99 per month", "New York: Apple Inc. will force iPhone apps to get permission from users before tracking them, dealing a potentially major blow to app developers who rely on advertisements to make money.New York: Apple Inc. will force iPhone apps to get permission from users before tracking them, dealing a potentially major blow to app developers who rely on advertisements to make money.The change, announced at Apple\u2019s virtual developer conference on Monday, is similar to a move the company made last year when it started sending notifications to users each time an app tried using their location.Apple facilitates tracking on its phones by providing app developers with unique numbers for each user, something security advocates have long said contradicts the company\u2019s frequent statements in support of privacy. The update to the iPhone\u2019s operating system doesn\u2019t do away with the tracking system, but makes it much more apparent to users and gives them more opportunities to turn it off. Previously, controls were buried in the phone\u2019s settings menu.Apple has heralded itself as a champion of user privacy, especially compared with other tech giants that rely on advertising, Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Apple started limiting tracking on its Safari web browser in 2017. Earlier this year, Google said it would do the same for its Chrome browser after a two-year consultation with the advertising industry.- BloombergAlso read:Apple\u2019s iOS 14 update to come with redesigned iPhone home screen, translation app & more", "Shares of Sonos Inc.

", "SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Monday (Jun 22) announced\u00a0a new system that lets users share digital car keys with friends and family members via the company's iMessage system, which will work with BMW 5 Series vehicles.The system will work with iPhones running the current iOS 13 operating system\u00a0so that owners can start using it when BMW vehicles arrive. Apple said more cars that work with the system will come to market next year.Apple also updated its mapping application with information about electric vehicle charging stations, working with BMW and Ford Motor\u00a0to show stations compatible with the user's vehicle.Apple\u00a0on Monday also\u00a0said it will switch to its own chips for its Mac computers, saying the first machines will ship this year and ending a nearly 15-year reliance on Intel Corp to supply processors for its flagship laptops and desktop.Apple chief executive Tim Cook said it marked the beginning of a major new era for a product line powered the company's rise in the 1980s and its resurgence in the late 1990s.The silicon switch brings the Mac into line with the company's iPhone and iPads, which already use Apple-designed chips. Cook said that Apple expects the Mac transition to take about two years and that Apple still has some Intel-based computers in its pipeline that it will support for \"many years\".But the move will give software developers for Apple's largest pool of third-party apps - those built for iPhones and iPads - new access to its laptops and desktop for the first time. Apple software chief Craig Federighi said that for those offerings, \"most apps will just work, with no changes from the developer\" on the new Macs.\u00a0The news came at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. The conference has gained new prominence since paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the company's revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades.\u00a0Apple takes a 15 per cent\u00a0to 30 per cent\u00a0cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple's mobile devices.Those fees, and Apple's strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company.In what appeared to be an acknowledgement of its some of its critics, Apple said it would let users select non-Apple apps as default apps for tasks like email and web browsing on iPhones and iPads.But developers still gravitate toward Apple's platform because it is lucrative, with a user base that is willing to spend money on paid apps. The annual developer conference, being held online this year for the first time because of COVID-19, is where Apple often announces access to new hardware capabilities, such as special tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality.Apple also added new privacy protections, saying it would let users only share their approximate location with app developers and that it would require those developers to seek permission before sharing user data with other apps and websites.\u00a0Apple also said it would require a privacy and security label, akin to a food nutrition label, to be shown to users before they download apps.\u00a0", "                            An Apple Watch illustration is displayed during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 22.

The tool will include a \u201cwind down\u201d feature a user will access while preparing for bed. It will integrate with a new sleep section in the Health app on the iPhone.The new hand-washing monitor tells users how long they should wash their hands. A redesigned Fitness app in the new software, called watchOS 7, can track dancing and core training workouts. The new software will come with some visual enhancements, too. The company will add new faces including one with a larger clock and a big complication, as well as the ability to share watch face designs with others. Apple didn\u2019t say when the new software would be made available.The Apple Watch, first released in 2015, has been a key component of diversifying the company\u2019s hardware sales. The watch has gotten new hardware and software face lifts each year, and new models are expected later this year. The product is part of Apple\u2019s accessories segment, which generated nearly $25 billion for Apple last fiscal year, or about 10% of sales. Last quarter, the segment was Apple\u2019s second-largest after the iPhone.5G will initially be 'a disappointment' for Apple: Loup Ventures' Gene MunsterApple said to be readying for autumn launch of Apple TV+ at US$9.99 per month", "Powered by strong returns for shares of Nike and Apple Inc., the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up Monday afternoon.

The deal enables the social media giant to access the Swedish company\u2019s trove of street-view maps and imagery data.Mapillary, similar to Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL-division Google, provides maps that show road signs, addresses and other information around a locality.However, instead of sending a fleet of camera and sensor-fitted vehicles like the aforementioned tech giants, Mapillary relies on crowdsourced (tens of thousands of contributors) images on its platform. The company\u2019s software extracts and analyzes data from the uploaded images.Mapillary\u2019s maps are useful in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) applications. They are also needed to improve navigational abilities of self-driving vehicles as well as support drones and robots for contactless delivery of goods.Notably, the maps will power Facebook Marketplace that drives transactions for millions of small businesses. Moreover, the acquisition will support Facebook\u2019s endeavors to build AR glasses as well as VR headsets. The company offers VR products through its Oculus division.Markedly, AR/VR is a space that is witnessing heightened competition with a number of initiatives from Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT, Apple and Snapchat-parent Snap SNAP.Mapillary will be part of Facebook\u2019s broader open mapping initiative. Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company offers a service called Map With AI, which with the support of AI, helps in road-mapping. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\u00a0Google Dominates Map SpaceFacebook\u2019s Mapillary deal undoubtedly intensifies competition in the mapping space currently dominated by Google. Apple, Amazon AMZN and NVIDIA NVDA thanks to its partnership with HERE, are other notable players in the space.Google\u2019s dominant position can be attributed to its expertise in infusing AI into maps. The company frequently updates its map application and offers eye-catching features. In February, Google released a new updated app that focused on five categories, Explore, Commute, Saved, Contribution and Updates.Moreover, the company has put more emphasis on user-generated content and recommendations. Notably, Google came up with its crowdedness predictions feature last year. With this, it is easier for Google Map users to share information related to their transit lines. Notably, crowdedness predictions provide information about how crowded a bus, train or subway is likely to be.\u00a0This helps people in making decisions regarding whether to take the ride or wait for the next in order to avoid the crowd, an important feature amid the coronavirus outbreak.In fact, Google-parent Alphabet, which also carries a Zacks Rank #3, has taken a number of initiatives to fight the spread of the virus. The company recently updated Google Maps with COVID-19 alerts and advanced features. Additionally, the recently-introduced insights like temperature, accessibility and security onboard have been made available globally.These benefits are likely to deliver enhanced user experience, which in turn will bolster the adoption of Google Maps.Apple Gets Boost From Maps RedesignEarly this year, Apple completed the rollout of its redesigned Apple Maps in the United States. The updated app doesn\u2019t require sign-in and is not connected to an Apple ID. Moreover, the redesigned app offers improved navigation and better road coverage.Through the new Look Around feature, Apple offers interactive street-level imagery with high-resolution, 3D photography. The feature is much similar to Google\u2019s Street View.Initially rolled out in the New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston and Oahu, Apple extended the Look Around feature to Boston, Chicago, Washington DC, and Philadelphia.\u00a0Apple Inc.

QuoteMoreover, it\u2019s Nearby feature, which helps an user search for a wide range of services close to his/her current location, has been extended to an additional 31 countries, including India.Further, Apple has teamed up with Google to fight coronavirus through a contact-tracing app. The iPhone maker, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, announced a new set of tools that will allow mobile devices to trade information via Bluetooth connections to alert people when they are in close proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Moreover, Apple Maps are helping iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac users search for coronavirus testing centers. In April, Apple made its mobility trends data available, supported by Apple Maps in order to provide local authorities more insight that would help them prevent the spread of COVID-19.Additionally, per 9TO5Mac report, Apple recently updated Apple Maps with real-time transit information now available for a number of U.S. cities and States, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, majority of the U.K. (excluding Northern Ireland) and selected citiesZacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2020?Last year's 2019 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio returned gains as high as +102.7%.

", "Apple and Google have been working for the last few months to build a standard that can assist with CovidI-19 exposure notification. As the technology has started to roll out to devices, a lot of people who may not have been paying attention are suddenly wondering why they now have a setting for \"COVID-19 Exposure Logging,\" and whether that means that their iPhone is tracking them.There is, understandably, some understandable confusion about what exactly that setting means, and whether it's a problem that Apple would add such a feature even without users asking for it.I've written about how that technology works, but here's a basic overview:Those keys are also using AES encryption, which prevents someone from intercepting personal information that could be used to identify the device or individual. Apple and Google also indicated that the keys don't include location information, which provides another layer of privacy protection.As restaurants, offices, book stores, and schools start to reopen, there's obviously a greater chance that any of us may be exposed to that very situation. Apple and Google recognized early on that creating a common standard that would allow iOS and Android devices to share keys via Bluetooth would give public health organizations a powerful tool in fighting the spread of the pandemic.At the same time, both tech companies realized that the tool would only be useful if people actually use it. That only happens if users are sure that their privacy is being protected and that their sensitive health information isn't being collected by Apple or Google, or that it isn't being stored on a central server--especially one that the government could access.If you tap on the setting, you'll find that you can't even turn on the technology without installing an authorized app. Apple and Google have said they will only work with official public health organizations who develop apps.\u00a0", "GestureTek, Inc., Intel Corporation, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc., Cognitec Systems GmbH, OMRON Corporation, Infineon Technologies AG, SoftKinetic SA, Elliptic Laboratories AS, Crunchfish AB and others.GestureTek, Inc., Intel Corporation, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc., Cognitec Systems GmbH, OMRON Corporation, Infineon Technologies AG, SoftKinetic SA, Elliptic Laboratories AS, Crunchfish AB and others.", "The administration is proposing a new way of awarding H-1B visas, which are capped at 85,000 a year and used by Indian technology giants as well as companies like Amazon Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., the official said.

On Monday, the tech company announced at its annual\u00a0Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC,\u00a0a new feature that uses the smartphone to unlock and start a car.While Apple's years-long ambition\u00a0to build its own vehicle\u00a0hasn't materialized, its CarPlay infotainment system is available in 97% of new cars, according to the company.\"They've been around for over 100 years but they've become big, bulky and ripe for reimagining,\" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering.Apple will first roll out the feature on the 2021 BMW 5 Series, but wants to expand it to other car models.Emily Schubert, Apple senior manager of car experience engineering, demonstrated how a driver can tap the door handle with their iPhone to unlock the sedan. Then drivers place the iPhone on the car's charging pad and push the ignition button to start the car. The Apple technology relies on what's known as Near Field Communication, which allows devices within a few centimeters of each other to exchange data wirelessly. Apple plans to transition to using a different technology, ultra wideband, which will allow for unlocking from greater distances. An iPhone could remain in a driver's pocket or bag.Apple is working with standards groups to pave the way for expanding the technology to more cars. Federighi said it expects to see support for the new ultra wideband standard in new vehicles next year.In May, an industry group, the Car Connectivity Consortium, announced\u00a0a standardized way to store digital keys.

Facing developer backlash and antitrust scrutiny, Apple Inc. has quietly announced it would be making a few tweaks to its App Store developer policies. The company said in a press release late Monday that it plans to implement two changes to its app review process later this summer.

Apple takes a cut of revenue when users make in-app purchases of services through third-party apps, prompting some developers to bypass in-app subscriptions altogether and instead steer users toward web browsers for their purchases.Shortly before WWDC kicked off, Apple found itself in a high-profile dispute with the developers of Hey, an email app that charges $99 a year for its services but didn\u2019t allow customers to pay for a subscription within the app. Apple rejected Hey\u2019s software update containing bug fixes because the company didn\u2019t have an in-app payment option, but after some public sparring, Apple agreed to approve Hey\u2019s bug fixes once developers created a free-trial option that users would be able to sign up for within the app itself.Large developers including Tinder-parent Match Group Inc.

New iOS 14 features aimed at limiting that data collection\u00a0may hurt small businesses.The new iOS 14\u00a0that Apple plans to release later this year will come with a variety of privacy improvements that\u00a0limit how apps and websites can track users. Among the changes, Apple is planning to add settings to websites and apps, to let users decide when, how, and even whether companies can track them. And with a new self-reporting feature for app developers, iOS 14 users can see which companies are gathering their data, and decide whether they can live with that -- or not.\u00a0In recent years, mobile advertising has soared as companies go to where their customers are. But rather than spend money haphazardly, small businesses tend to focus their budgets on the apps and services they know their customers are using. Gathering valuable insight from usage, location data, and other services allows them to do that. Apple's new privacy rules\u00a0could have a profoundly negative impact on the average small business's ad conversion.It's understandable that Apple wants to safeguard user privacy, but it may find that it's doing so\u00a0at the expense of\u00a0smaller businesses and developers\u00a0just trying to stay online during a recession and\u00a0pandemic.", "Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) kicked off its annual developer conference, the WWDC, in a new virtual format Monday.\u00a0The event highlighted Apple\u2019s ongoing innovation efforts, and the company faces strong ecosystem benefits in the long-term, according to Baird.William Power maintained an Outperform rating on Apple and raised\u00a0the price target from $320 to $390.Apple launched several software enhancements at WWDC20, although there were no real surprises, Power said in the Tuesday note. (See his track record here.)Cupertino continued to focus on privacy and also announced plans to shift to Apple Silicon for the Mac, the analyst said.\u00a0\u201cWith 1.5 billion devices in use globally, including over 900 million iPhones, we believe Apple's broader eco-system is positioned to continue to flourish,\u201d Power said.\u00a0Shares of Apple were up 2.96% at $369.48 at the time of publication Tuesday.\u00a0Tuesday's Market Minute: Apple Doubles Down On ServicesApple To Let Developers Challenge App Store Guidelines, Push Bug Fixes After UproarPhoto courtesy of Apple.\u00a0", "Apple Books US Bestseller List - 06/21/20 - Paid Books", "It\u00a0only took about two minutes of an almost two-hour keynote at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, but it was easily the most important thing the company announced today. A little more than halfway through, Apple\u00a0was describing its commitment to user privacy, when it\u00a0revealed that it will now require developers to disclose the information they use\u00a0to track you for digital advertising purposes.\u00a0Apple used the analogy of the labels on food products that disclose the ingredients and nutritional information. From a privacy standpoint, this is actually an even bigger deal.\u00a0According to Katie Skinner, Apple's manager of user privacy software, developers will have to detail exactly what information their app collects, and \"if they're sharing data with other companies to track you.\"\u00a0Never once were their names mentioned, but make no mistake, those \"other companies\" are \u00a0Google and Facebook. In fact, Apple took several thinly\u00a0veiled swipes at Google,\u00a0in particular, like when it described how browsers (like Google's Chrome) handle extensions and the privacy concerns associated with them.Apple also said that it will make these disclosures available in its App Stores so that users can see the information before they make a decision to download. Taking its stance on privacy even further, Apple will require that apps disclose when they are tracking you, and allow users the option of allowing it or not, similar to how iOS already handles requests for location tracking.Google and Facebook have built their entire businesses around the collection of your personal information and monetizing it\u00a0using that data to show you advertising. Much of that data comes not from your interactions on their respective sites but is based on your activity across the internet, or in apps on your smartphone.\u00a0Apple's SVP of software engineering, Craig Federighi,\u00a0reminded us again today that\u00a0\"at Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.\" With iOS 14, Apple is taking an even more direct shot at its peers who take\u00a0a decidedly different approach.Earlier this year, that difference was apparent in a panel conversation I observed that included\u00a0Facebook's VP of public policy, Erin Egan. In that conversation, Egan described Facebook's approach as \"privacy by design,\" a sentiment that actually caused people in the room to laugh.\u00a0In that regard, Apple's stance\u00a0has the potential to force us to reckon with the amount of information tech giants collect. That could be very good news for users, and very bad news for Facebook and Google.", "Technology and consumer-oriented stocks led the rally, with Apple posting an all-time record close, as investors responded to announcements from the tech giant\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference.

A few months later, Escobar Inc. repeated the formula of the Fold 2, now using the iPhone Pro instead.This scam was the same as the last one. They made the same videos that showed more women than the phone itself, they bought the ripapple.com domain as they did with Samsung, and they only delivered the Escobar Gold 11 to people who had a large fanbase, hoping to get the same level of attention they got in the past. So I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up if I were you.If you go to the Escobar Inc. website or to ripapple.com you\u2019ll still find the Escobar Gold 11 Pro on sale.

", "Jabil (NYSE: JBL) manufactures products for myriad sectors, but its top customer is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounted for 22% of its sales last year. Most of that revenue came from casings for iPhones and iPads.Jabil pulled its full-year outlook back in March due to the COVID-19 crisis, but its recent third-quarter report offered more clarity into its future ahead of Apple's next wave of iPhone launches.Jabil generated 62% of its revenue from its Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) unit, which produces products for the automotive, industrial, cloud, defense, energy, telecom, retail, and smart home markets. The remaining 38% of it came from its Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) unit, which manufactures products for healthcare, science, and technology companies -- including Apple.Its DMS revenue rose 13%, spurred by stronger orders from healthcare companies and smartphone makers like Apple -- even though management didn't mention the iPhone maker during its conference call.But next year, analysts expect Jabil's revenue and\u00a0earnings to rise 4% and 34%, respectively, as the near-term headwinds fade, the automotive sector rebounds, orders for 5G and cloud products accelerate, and orders for Apple's first 5G iPhones rise. That's an impressive growth rate for a stock that trades at just nine times forward earnings.Jabil is tethered to Apple's growth, but it isn't as heavily exposed as other suppliers like Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS), which generated 51% and 79% of\u00a0their revenues from Apple in their latest fiscal years, respectively. Therefore, investors who want stronger Apple supply chain plays might prefer those chipmakers over Jabil.Jabil's business is stabilizing, but its weaknesses are still overwhelming its strengths. For now, I'll reiterate my advice from earlier this year: Investors who want exposure to Apple should simply buy shares of Apple instead.Leo Sun owns shares of Apple.

There were no major reveals. No \u201cone more thing\u2026\u201d moments. Just incremental updates to existing software.If you want the full rundown without the risk of falling asleep at work, click here.Now, it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t like Apple as an innovator or a disruptor in the tech industry. Those days are gone.What I do like about Apple is that it doesn\u2019t make mistakes very often. The company is safe. Its leadership is smart, if conservative for a technology giant. Apple is boring to a fault, but it knows how to appease its massive customer following.As a result, Apple stock trades at all-time highs despite store closures and COVID-19 disruptions. As long as the company doesn\u2019t become the next IBM \u2014 i.e., fail to do the bare minimum on the innovation front for its customers \u2014 it should continue to set all-time highs. And it will remain boring while doing so.", "Yesterday\u00a0Apple (AAPL)\u00a0held its annual World Wide Developer Conference, its showcase for what\u2019s to be had in the coming months as it rolls out various updates across its software, hardware and developer platforms. The company did so virtually (and seamlessly), shaking up the format from previous years, but even without an audience,\u00a0it was an event that still brought the noise\u00a0with updates across the company\u2019s various platforms.It featured the news that Apple will begin transitioning to its own processors later this year from those supplied by Intel for its Macs, with that transition expected to span the next two years. For some time now, Apple has been expanding its internal chip design capabilities leveraging it into proprietary A-series chipsets for the iPhone, iPad and other devices, and in many ways this is a natural extension for a company that hangs its hat on not only its walled garden, but also on the tight integration of hardware and software and along with that a high level of device interoperability.\u00a0Right off the bat, the company didn\u2019t drop any hints about its widely expected 5G iPhone upgrade super cycle that many suspect will commence later this year. Not really a surprise given the event is geared towards the ecosystem that develops apps to run on Apple\u2019s existing and soon-to-be-announced devices.While we wait for the company\u2019s annual fall hardware event for the next must-have device, we can share some recent, and arguably telling, comments made by\u00a0AT&T (T)\u00a0at the\u00a0Wells Fargo (WFC)\u00a05G Forum last week that it expects to have over 15 5G specific devices available by the end of 2020, up from five today. AT&T noted its close relationship with Apple that charts all the way back to the first iPhone, but refused to say anything else about Apple\u2019s plans. Reading between the lines, AT&T\u2019s comments seem to suggest Apple will be game-on with\u00a05G iPhones\u00a0before the end of 2020.So what did Apple debut at WWDC 2020?There was no shortage of software enhancements and updates across Apple\u2019s iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, HomeKit, watchOS, voice interface Siri, CarPlay and the forthcoming macOS Big Sur designed to drive ease of use, productivity and take advantage of Apple\u2019s new chips for the Mac.Taking a higher view across the totality of its updates, some common themes and elements that emerge point to Apple\u2019s growing use of artificial intelligence and big data to drive that ease of use and productivity as well as its continuing focus on user data privacy. That focus on privacy included the announcement of privacy \u201cnutrition labels\u201d that will present what data apps are collecting and how they are using that data in a format that is easy to quickly digest. We see this as a firm reminder of the growing concern over data privacy and Apple\u2019s intent to embrace it as a competitive differentiator following the enacting of data privacy legislation in the Eurozone and several U.S. states.One of the standouts is the addition of CarKey that allows users to access their cars with the iPhone or share a \u201cdigital\u201d key with others, complete with usage limitations; this new service is slated to debut in iOS 14 but will also be enabled for devices running iOS 13. In keeping with Apple\u2019s focus on security and privacy, the secure element for CarKey will remain housed on the iPhone and can be remotely wiped via iCloud.As adoption for mobile payments, including Apple Pay, continues, we are increasingly closer to a day when smartphones could completely replace the wallet. A big next step there is how Apple and others handle passports, driver\u2019s licenses, ID cards and other forms of identification. Also adding another reason to carry one\u2019s iPhone everywhere and anywhere, Apple announced it will soon bring App Clip Codes, which combines visual codes, NFC and QR codes, to activate bite-sized versions of apps it is calling App Clips. The gist of App Clips is to enable the use of \"small parts\" of apps quickly without downloading the entire app. We suspect App Clips is yet another way to boost app discovery in the real world at shops, restaurants and other businesses that deploy App Clip Codes.With iPadOS, there will be a number of incremental improvements but a particularly shiny object was the refreshed Apple Pencil that, alongside the updated OS enables Scribble and Smart Selection, dramatically improves write to text capabilities, which in our view translates into a meaningful productivity boost for the iPad. Apple also debuted an update for its AirPods that will include automatic switching across Apple devices. Given our own frustration switching AirPods from our Macs to iPhones and other devices, we are crossing our fingers big time that this feature channels the words of Apple founder Steve Jobs \u2013 \u201cit just works.\u201d The new AirPods should also appeal to budding audiophiles out there as they will include spatial audio which is slated to deliver the \u201csurround sound\u201d experience.\u00a0The company\u2019s watchOS had a number of updates including the addition for tracking dance as part of its newly rechristened Fitness app, which has at least one of our team member doing a jig, and the ability to further customize Apple Watch faces. Apple also shared it is focusing on enhanced sleep tracking, the details of this functionality will be forthcoming, and an ability to sense when its wearer is washing their hands to help ensure the job is done thoroughly, especially in today\u2019s COVID-19 world.On the home front, Apple\u2019s HomeKit Software and tvOS will bring incremental security functionality through connected Cameras, define activity zones and contact based facial recognition.\u00a0Looking back on the event, it was more of what we have come to expect from Apple in that while it is rarely the first to deliver major new functionality, it does a fantastic job of enhancing that functionality\u00a0ultimately creating a superior aesthetic and overall user experience. Some may see many of yesterday\u2019s announcements as incremental but in aggregate they further the growing interconnectedness of Apple\u2019s offerings and cement its place in Tematica\u2019s Digital Lifestyle investing theme, especially for those increasingly concerned about their data privacy.

China\u2019s regulators require all games that are either paid or offer in-app purchases to submit for review and obtain a license before publication, and major Android app stores have enforced such rules since 2016.

For its part, Apple has begun ramping up oversight of its Chinese app store, removing two podcast apps earlier this month at China\u2019s request.Back in February, Apple reminded iOS developers in the country to obtain licenses for their titles by June 30. But it was only after prolonged uncertainty about enforcement that the iPhone maker explicitly told publishers that any unlicensed games after the deadline will be banned and removed from the local App Store, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is not public.There\u2019s no telling how long it will take to remove all unlicensed games once the change comes into effect.

There's also the ability to add multiple instances of the same app within complications on the display. That can be really useful when it comes to a variety of different productivity apps.I happen to think that the Apple Watch is one of the most powerful productivity tools you can use. I've even shared some of those productivity tricks in the past, like how you can use it to set reminders, find your iPhone, or share your location via iMessage. Now, watchOS 7 includes at least one feature that I think is a game-changer in terms of productivity: Sleep tracking.By doing so, you train your body that it's time for bed, and time to go to sleep. In fact, in a statement, Apple points out that \"according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, a bedtime routine helps the body prepare for sleep.\"When you wake up, the Apple Watch has a specific display, which highlights the current battery charge. Since the Apple Watch charges relatively quickly, most people can simply place the watch on its charger while they get ready for their day.The updated\u00a0watchOS will not only track your sleep patterns, but it will also make suggestions about when you should go to sleep and when you should wake up. It also has what Apple calls \"Wind Down\" mode to help you prepare yourself for bed. Even better, this applies to both your Watch and iPhone. Your iPhone will even suggest activities like playing a specific playlist, turning on an alarm, or even launching your preferred meditation app.Now your Apple Watch can now help you be more prepared and productive when you start your day\u00a0by helping you develop a routine the night before. Not only that, but there's also a side benefit: more sleep.", "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced a robust line-up of new technologies to help its 23 million developers design and build the apps of tomorrow. These new tools will enable developers to bring more powerful app experiences to Apple\u2019s industry-leading platforms, and help them better manage and grow their businesses. In addition to Apple\u2019s annual developer survey, WWDC20 will feature an online App Store\u00ae lab so that developers from around the world can share their feedback and help inform future improvements to the App Store. Apple is also adding new forums for developers to relay suggestions throughout the coming year and beyond.\u201cThe Apple developer community inspires us all with apps that help more than a billion users, transform industries, and change the world. This WWDC, we\u2019ve introduced innovative new APIs, frameworks, and tools designed to help developers take their app experiences further and reach even more users,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cThe App Store ecosystem is more diverse, dynamic, and successful than it has ever been, but we know that to make it better for everyone, there is more we must do together. This year at WWDC20, we\u2019ve added online App Store Labs, extended the annual App Store developer survey, and more because we want to hear directly from hundreds of thousands of developers on how they want us to improve the App Store for them, and for users.\u201dGreater Access to Apple PlatformsThis year, Apple is providing developers with even more ways to deeply integrate their apps into core platform features in order to deliver powerful functionality in a way that also protects user privacy and security. The new Find My network accessory program lets third-party device makers take advantage of a network with hundreds of millions of devices, while continuing to offer end-to-end encryption so only the user can see the location of their item. HomePod\u2122 also has a new program to integrate third-party music services. Email and browser app developers can offer their apps as default options, selectable by users. And Safari\u00ae for Mac\u00ae is adding support for the popular WebExtensions API used by Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, making it easy for extension developers to work with Safari and to distribute through the Mac App Store.It\u2019s easier than ever for developers to make their games shine on Apple\u2019s platforms using the latest updates to the beautifully redesigned Game Center. Updates include recurring leaderboards, a new in-game dashboard, and enhanced recommendations through Friends Playing, where users can discover games that are popular with their Game Center friends.Xcode is at the center of all development on Apple\u2019s platforms, and with Xcode 12, it has a fresh new look to match macOS Big Sur. New document tabs make opening multiple files fast and lightweight to support interface files, and logs and project files each open in their own tab. Navigator fonts now match the system size, or can be set to small, medium, or large. And Xcode 12 builds macOS Universal apps by default to support new Macs with Apple silicon.SwiftUI introduced developers to a modern UI framework that made it more intuitive than ever to build sophisticated app UIs. This year, new life cycle APIs let developers write an entire app in SwiftUI and share that code across all Apple platforms. Developers who have already started with SwiftUI will easily be able to add new features to their existing code, and a new Lazy API ensures enormous data sets will offer great performance.During WWDC20, Apple is also launching an online version of the App Store lab to further support the Apple developer community across all of its platforms. In the past, the in-person App Store lab has helped inform and prioritize new App Store features and capabilities, as well as updates to App Store policies. This year, developers are encouraged to share their feedback at the virtual lab or through an additional survey channel that will collect submissions through June 26. The survey, now in its fourth year, reaches half a million developers and represents a critical pathway of feedback for improvements leading to App Store developer services such as TestFlight\u00ae public links and the ability to respond to customer reviews.Apple will also create additional channels for developers to share feedback during new developer forums that will occur throughout the coming year. In these forums, developers are encouraged to share their suggestions, large and small, so that Apple may continue to implement changes and improve the App Store experience for the entire developer community.Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

Today\u2019s lofty valuation relies on these bets to pay off, big, and there is a degree of uncertainty there that I am not necessarily comfortable with.Source: marketingland.comA company like Apple needs no introduction and anyone who has had the foresight of investing in the company knows just how much value the company has delivered to both investors and consumers. But with over $1.53 trillion in market cap and the growth in smartphone devices tapering off; What can we expect from Apple moving forward? Are its best days behind it?Apple has some amazing qualities. Its phones are in a league of their own, and this differentiation protects them from the competition. The balance sheet is as strong as you\u2019d want it to be and the company\u2019s debt is viewed as higher quality than that of many developed countries. But the question remains; where is the growth going to come from? Apple already faces the challenge of being a huge company. Furthermore, the IDC predicts the smartphone market will grow at a CAGR of 2%.Given what we know about Apple, we have used our trendline analysis to forecast cash-flow and derive an expected return based on today\u2019s price. Below we can see a simplified balance sheet, income statement, and some growth ratios for the forecasted period as well as a target price/return based on the discount you apply. The B/S and income statement shown here are for the next 10 (2021-2030) years, but the forecasted period and target price/return is reached through a full forecast ending in 2050.This analysis is purely mathematical and assumes that Apple will continue to operate as is, without innovating, which is unlikely. Still, it is useful to understand Apple and how investors value it. Our forecast shows growth plateauing at 1.7% over the long-run. At today\u2019s price, this implies a return of 1.1% As stated above, Apple looks more like a bond than a stock by this analysis.Unless something drastically changes, Apple is way overpriced. Of course, there is a degree of safety and stability that comes with owning Apple, but with such a low return the stock looks more like a Treasury than equity.Apple will have to do something special to justify its valuation, and there\u2019s no reason to believe they can\u2019t. Here are three things that could change the growth outlook of the company.One important change to look out for is Apple making its semiconductors. The company recently announced they would ditch Intel (INTC) and begin designing their silicon microchips. It is important to note that Apple will only be designing the software, while it will be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) manufacturing them.This move doesn\u2019t mean that Apple will be competing with the likes of NVIDIA (NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but it does show Apple\u2019s intentions to be self-sufficient and, most importantly, to expand on its unique software which in the future could power a lot more than their computers. In this regard, Apple could certainly pioneer some useful technologies in the AI space. Furthermore, this will also put Apple in a much better position to leverage its technologies and integrate itself further in the future, leading to even higher profitability.Speaking of profitability, Apple also made a big move in the smartphone market by tackling the lower side of the demand curve, i.e. selling a cheaper phone. The iPhone SE is the cheapest iPhone available, with the price coming in around $400. While many have argued that this could eat into Apple\u2019s profit margins and cannibalize its sales, most people who own an iPhone, not my case, don\u2019t see this as a substitute. The cheaper model doesn\u2019t lower the brands\u2019 \u201cvalue\u201d and in most cases, I don\u2019t think it will reduce the money people are willing to spend on an iPhone. The people buying an iPhone for $1000 aren\u2019t doing so begrudgingly because they can\u2019t buy one for $400.The data above shows market Share in India shipments of smartphones. The reason you don\u2019t see Apple there is because it is buried in \u201cOthers\u201d, with about 1-2% share. The SE, which not coincidentally is being manufactured in India could change things for Apple in what I am sure is one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets in the world right now.Last, but not least, Apple Pay is perhaps one of the most interesting segments in Apple. According to research, about 5% of cashless transactions in the world are done using Apple Pay. The segment has been growing at double-digits and, if the trend continues, could soon take up over 10% of transactions.Cashlessness has become unavoidable, and players in the fintech space are going to win big thanks to this. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Apple Pay is growing faster than Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL).The points mentioned above, give us reason to believe that Apple could continue to achieve higher growth and break the trend of the last few years.With all this in mind, we have adjusted growth rates to reflect what the market is probably expecting from Apple. The system is still based on trendline analysis but we have manually boosted revenue. Here are the results:The thesis presented above isn\u2019t necessarily in favor nor against Apple. We have presented two scenarios based on some assumptions. It is unlikely that Apple will stagnate with smartphones. But if Apple wants to grow into its valuation, its bets have to come through. If this doesn\u2019t happen, valuation could come down significantly. Only time will tell and I will be watching it unfold on the sidelines.", "A user can pay for fuel with a stored credit or debit card. The app also works with Google Pay and Apple Pay.

Apple announced that iOS14 Maps will track a driver\u2019s current charge (factoring in such variables as elevation and weather) to add EV charging stops along a route automatically. Apple Maps will identify charging alternatives for specific vehicles, making sure they route to compatible stations and indicate the charge rate provided at the location. For example, Blink\u2019s fast 80 amp equipment will be listed as providing up to 19.2kW for Tesla vehicles as well as all-new electric vehicles entering the marketplace with those charging capabilities.During the conference, Apple also announced that it is working with a number of auto manufacturers to support EV routing in their vehicles, including BMW and Ford, with plans to add more automakers in the future.\u00a0Michael D. Farkas, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blink, commented, \u201cThe addition of EV charge routing capabilities to the updated Apple Maps App is a tremendous step forward for the growth of the EV industry. The App will help enable EV drivers to take to the road with the confidence that their charging needs can be met and will make it even easier for EV drivers to benefit from Blink\u2019s growing network of charging stations. Whether identifying and routing to convenient charging stations during a long road trip or providing the most compatible charging locations for use when a car will be parked for a lengthy period of time, this enhanced Apple Maps feature benefits current EV owners. It is an attractive attribute for those considering an EV purchase.\u201d\u201cWe are excited about Apple Maps routing its EV Driver users to Blink charging stations and providing its over 20 million monthly visitors with information about Blink charging stations across the US, including charging speeds, type, and availability. We are happy to see this next step by Apple to continue to make electric vehicle charge accessible for all and further reduce range anxiety,\u201d commented Farkas.This press release\u00a0is an independent publication and has not been authorized, sponsored, or otherwise approved by Apple Inc.

AMZN,          -2.24%       has reported a healthy increase in black employees, to 26.5%, but those numbers are thought to largely rely on warehouse and delivery workers instead of the tech-focused workforce.  The same could be said for Apple\u2019s retail workers.", "Apple iPhone manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron and local handset makers Karbonn, Lava and Dixon have applied for the Centre\u2019s Rs 41,000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which seeks to establish India as an export hub rivaling northeast Asia\u2019s electronics powerhouses.In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has imposed taxes on imports of key smartphone components to encourage electronics manufacturing in India to boost the country\u2019s economic growth. Along with local firms such as Lava, global smartphone giants including Samsung, Apple and Xiaomi are expanding rapidly in India.Apple, the world\u2019s third-largest smartphone maker has started manufacturing the iPhone 7 models in India, in addition to iPhone SE and iPhone 6s. The cost of making iPhone 7 devices in India is cheaper than importing them due to the duty concessions any handset maker gets on local manufacturing, a move aimed at boosting the government\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.

Despite the drop, the U.S technology giant reported growth in revenue in other areas of business. This will help Apple remain resilient in one of its biggest markets.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a drop in iPhone sales in China after initial rebound as lockdowns eased after a drop in COVID-19 infections. Despite the drop, the U.S technology giant reported growth in revenue in other areas of business. This will help Apple remain resilient in one of its biggest markets.Market data collected from third-party sources point a mixed picture for the company\u2019s performance in China in May.\u00a0 The company sold 3.6 million iPhones in May, compared to 3.9 million in April. Apple, however, sold 3.05 million iPhones in May 2019, and reported a 160% month-on-month rise in April, thanks to increased demand in China. The company also saw a rebound in sales as the economy was eased following COVID-19 lockdowns.The company\u2019s iPhone sales in China dropped 60% in February compared to a year ago. This was attributed to Apple\u2019s closure of stores in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns that saw economies across the world closed. Apple reopened many of its stores in China in mid-March.According to a report by research firm, IDC, Apple sold more than 2 million iPhones to its retail partners in China in May. This represents a 25% month-on-month drop. Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology shows that there was a 20% drop in smartphone shipment in China in May from April.Apple is moving ahead with its plan to migrate Mac to its own homegrown silicon with questions raised over the ability and strength of its ARM chips to replace those from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). It is yet to give a definitive answer even as developers waited keenly during this year\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).Apple\u2019s ARM-powered Macs will have in-built Rosetta 2 conversion software that helps translate some existing Intel apps automatically. The company has been assuring developers that ARM will offer them a whole new level of performance.", "In a year of ridiculous stories, Roberto Escobar (brother of the somewhat infamous Pablo) suing Apple for $2.6 billion is one of the best.Thing is, while we have the strong suspicion this is a nothing but a\u00a0publicity stunt\u00a0for Escobar Inc., we don\u2019t know this for certain. Especially now it looks like Apple will actually have to deal with this lawsuit head on.To summarize,\u00a0the Escobar vs. Apple case revolves around a FaceTime security issue in Roberto\u2019s iPhone X. He alleges this eventually led to his life being endangered, as the breach allowed hackers to get his home address and send him a threatening letter, causing him mental anguish.The first part of the lawsuit \u2014 the Breach of Contract section \u2014 covers Escobar being sold a device that an Apple reseller assured\u00a0him couldn\u2019t \u201cbe exploited\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be \u201cvulnerable to future exploits,\u201d something that eventually happened.He said that this complaint is based on an oral agreement between Escobar and the Apple reseller. If it\u2019s going to progress, Roberto will need to provide \u201csufficient evidence,\u201d something that\u2019s difficult to do when there\u2019s no documentation.Now, onto the second part of Escobar vs. Apple case: his complaint\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cNegligence/Negligent Misrepresentation.\u201d In summary, this section claims that Apple should\u2019ve notified Escobar about the aforementioned FaceTime security issue.Tomaschek states that although it took Apple nine days after the discovery of the bug to patch it, the company did \u201ctake action and [publicly acknowledge] and [resolve] the issue.\u201dFinally, the third cause of action in the Escobar vs. Apple lawsuit is\u00a0Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, something Tomaschek calls \u201cparticularly rich.\u201dThe core element is that Roberto Escobar believes the iPhone security breach put him through mental anguish, meaning he had to spend more money on private security.\u00a0Tomaschek believes this has more to do with \u201chis involvement in \u2026 the Medell\u00edn drug cartel\u201d than \u201cApple selling him an iPhone.\u201dNow we come to crux of the matter: does Roberto Escobar have any chance of winning this case against Apple?This doesn\u2019t mean everything will be rosy for Apple though.We\u2019ve already covered Escobar denying Apple\u2019s request for a 30 day extension of this case, and Perry told me that the company is in a \u201ctricky spot.\u201dHe said that if it dismisses the case too early, the judge will take Escobar\u2019s allegations as true and \u201cdetermine if there are colorable claims.\u201d This means the Escobar vs. Apple case will have to be \u201ceither resolved between the parties or decided on its merits.\u201dAnd what does Perry thing will eventually happen? Well, he thinks it\u2019ll \u201cgarner publicity and legal costs for Apple,\u201d and the parties will likely \u201csettle before trial.\u201d Which could mean some cash for Escobar.He finalizes this statement by saying it\u2019s highly unlikely \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction would ever find that Apple breached a duty of care to Escobar.\u201dTomaschek also had some choice words regarding the case. He told me the entire episode is \u201ca piece of showmanship designed to drum up a bit of publicity.\u201d Which is pretty close to what we said when we first covered this case.", "The app, named COCOA for Contact-Confirming Application, was designed by Microsoft Corp and is available for Apple Inc's iPhone and devices using Google's Android software.The app, named COCOA for Contact-Confirming Application, was designed by Microsoft Corp and is available for Apple Inc's iPhone and devices using Google's Android software.", "BELLEVUE, Wash., June  25, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Parallels today released Parallels\u00ae Mac Management 8.5 (parallels.com/mac-management) for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (formerly known as Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager or SCCM). Version 8.5 adds the ability for enterprises to manage iPad and iPhone mobile devices at no cost until the end of 2020 in addition to the Mac device management features it already brings to Microsoft SCCM. It is the only solution that enables SCCM management and central inventory of all Apple devices\u2014along with Windows devices\u2014through the Microsoft SCCM control panel, eliminating the need for a separate expensive infrastructure and resources to manage Apple devices.\u00a0\u00a0User-Initiated MDM Enrollment of Apple Devices Parallels Mac Management for Microsoft SCCM already provided inventory reporting on Mac devices. Now version 8.5 enables IT admins to make iOS mobile devices and macOS devices accountable through user-initiated enrollment. Managers simply send a link to users so they can manually enroll their iOS and macOS devices into Microsoft Endpoint Management with MDM for improved security and productivity, freeing admins from having to manually enroll each mobile device.Reporting Apple Mobile Device InventoryOnce iOS devices are enrolled, Parallels Mac Management can start collecting device inventory information on a predefined schedule and feed that into SCCM. Admins can use this data to generate reports and create targeted device collections to get a more comprehensive and detailed inventory of the Apple devices in their network. Now SCCM admins can have one true central inventory of all Apple and Windows devices on their network\u2014laptops, desktops, phones and tablets\u2014through a single pane of glass.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deploying Configuration Profiles to Apple iOS DevicesCorporate regulations for endpoint enrollment are becoming more stringent. Fortunately, SCCM managers can now configure settings in advance and then use Parallels Mac Management 8.5 to deploy configuration profiles to a collection of Apple iOS devices in their network. These settings typically include network and security policies, so these profiles can streamline user and device onboarding, as well as enforce security policies and regulatory compliance requirements. Managers can configure profiles for iOS mobile devices using the familiar workflow through SCCM that is typically used for Mac computers.\u00a9 2020 Parallels International GmbH. \u00a0Parallels, and \u00a0the Parallels logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Parallels International GmbH in Canada, the United States and/or other countries.

As a result, the first car to feature Apple CarKey will be the 2021MY BMW 5 Series. In this case, the system is dubbed the \u2018BMW Digital Key\u2019. It was only recently that Bavarian automaker debuted the mid-size saloon\u2019s performance variant, M5.In its simplest form, Apple CarKey lets the iPhone be used as a key to lock or unlock a vehicle. After getting in, the system can start up the engine (or power unit) once the iPhone is placed in a smartphone tray. Configurable via BMW Smartphone App, the Digital Key can be shared with up to five users. Drivers can control a range of functions such as restricting top speed, vehicle output and radio volume.

This is similar to the way Apple\u2019s Face ID and Wallet information are saved. Apple CarKey is compatible with Apple Watch and in the event of the phone getting turned off due to low battery, a five-hour power reserve would keep the system functional.While this is a first for the Apple iPhone, the Tesla Model 3 was the first automobile which allowed smartphones to be used as a digital key.

Both are giant tech companies\u00a0full of very smart people building some very innovative products. Some of those products even overlap. They both make smartphones and the operating systems that power them, and both make billions of dollars selling those products and services to\u00a0businesses and consumers.\u00a0Despite those similarities, the way the two companies view their relationship with their customers couldn't be more different. And that difference couldn't have been more clear than it was on Monday, when Apple took several not-so-veiled swipes at Google over privacy during its WWDC keynote. \u00a0That's the polar opposite approach from Apple, which has made privacy one of the core values of its brand and has actually built it into its products and services. For example, consider how Apple handles location information.

The coronavirus pandemic provided a good opportunity to face that fact and\u00a0throw in the towel.(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Microsoft Corp.\u00a0was never going to rival Apple Inc. in retail, or gain much from it. The coronavirus pandemic provided a good opportunity to face that fact and\u00a0throw in the towel.On Friday, the software\u00a0giant announced it will permanently close all of its Microsoft Store brick-and-mortar locations. The company\u2019s stores, which were primarily based inside malls, were temporarily shuttered\u00a0in late March in response to\u00a0the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, Microsoft says it won\u2019t\u00a0reopen them and will instead\u00a0invest only in\u00a0digital offerings to serve its customers \u2013 including one-on-one video conferencing\u00a0customer support, online training and workshops. Shutting down the stores will result in an approximate\u00a0$450 million pre-tax charge for Microsoft\u2019s current quarter, or five\u00a0cents a\u00a0share, the company said.\u00a0The move marks the end of a chapter for a strategy that didn\u2019t make much sense in the first place. In 2009, Microsoft started its retail store chain\u00a0in an obvious quest to\u00a0follow up on Apple\u2019s retail magic. The company eventually built out some 83 stores in total, compared to Apple\u2019s 510 locations today. But from the beginning it seemed like the Microsoft Store concept was an inferior copycat, using a similar design aesthetic with its long wood product display tables and all glass exteriors, that was never as good as the original.\u00a0Whenever I visited local malls, the Microsoft Store was always nearly empty compared to the Apple Store, which was regularly packed with customers.The thing\u00a0is, Apple always had a wide array of popular hardware and devices to sell \u2013 from smartphones, computers to tablets \u2013 along with a passionate customer\u00a0base that thirsted for those products. Microsoft had neither of those things. Perhaps the early failure of Microsoft\u2019s Zune music player, compared with Apple\u2019s iPod, is a great symbolic example of the divide between the two companies. Yes, Microsoft does have a moderately successful lineup of laptops and its Xbox consoles are a big player in the videogame\u00a0industry, but\u00a0there was never a true need to offer a retail destination for its products that were easily available for purchase elsewhere.5G will initially be 'a disappointment' for Apple: Loup Ventures' Gene MunsterApple said to be readying for autumn launch of Apple TV+ at US$9.99 per month", "In a sea change, Apple\u00a0Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are exiting Intel Corp.\u2019s x86 processor architecture for their personal computers.Apple has been using x86 for 15 years, Microsoft for more than 30 years. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook (pictured)\u00a0announced the transition to the Arm Ltd.-based PC\u00a0for the macOS at its online Worldwide Developers Conference this week and said it would complete the process by 2021. Microsoft is also investing in Arm-based PC chips and PCs for Windows and is planning to remove the software migration barriers by 2021.Both Apple and Microsoft want to reverse the steady decline in PC shipments and see PC growth again. Both want to sell additional software and services to the Arm-based PC, though both platforms will be supporting x86 PCs for a long time.Any transition is a big and risky business decision. However, our research concludes that the likely benefits of moving are worth the transition execution risk for Apple and Microsoft. Wikibon, SiliconANGLE\u2019s sister market research firm, projects an initial gradual adoption of the Arm-based PC, accelerating over the rest of the decade. Also, Wikibon sees a significant increase in overall PC shipments over the second half of this decade.These factors will lead to a sleeker and more powerful Arm-based PC with better battery life. The Apple and Windows PC platforms will become a high-end extension of the smartphone and tablet platforms. They will offer more functions and have access to a broader array of applications.Apple and Microsoft are investing substantially in the software migration to the Arm-based PC. This code includes AI inference, virtual reality and significant enhancements to real-time photography, video and audio. Wikibon projects that Arm-based PC shipments will increase significantly over the second half of this decade to about 300 million PCs shipped annually by the end of the decade. Wikibon believes the Arm-based PC will make users more productive.There are two important caveats to this projection: This assumes that x86 vendors do not change their design and manufacturing strategies significantly during the early part of this decade and that Apple and Microsoft continue to invest aggressively in the Arm-based PC and its software ecosystem.Linux became the base for most developers. Apple used it with the Arm processors at the historic announcement of the iPod Nano in 2006. Two years later, it became the underlying iOS in the iPhone. Google used Linux and Arm processors for Android development, and Linux was on its way to dominating the consumer and device markets.After former CEO Steve Ballmer\u2019s one Microsoft, Satya Nadella made it clear that each Microsoft product line has to stand on its own. His\u00a0first announcement when he took over in 2014 was to release Microsoft Office support on Apple iOS and move it to a continuous subscription model with OS365. That soon extended to every OS, and Windows lost its monopoly of Microsoft Office.The volume of Arm-based processors shipped is 10 times greater than x86 processors. This fact, together with the disaggregation of Arm-based processor production from design,\u00a0has led to the processor fabrication companies leading Intel by at least two generations. Apple will move to five-nanometer process production in 2020, whereas most x86 PC shipments are on 10- or 14-nanometer. As a result, Arm-processors have\u00a0higher performance, lower costs, lower energy requirements and better functionality.Apple operates at the high end of the PC market. In 2019, Apple shipped 18 million PCs, up 6.9%) Its revenue was $22.9 billion, up 13.5%, at an average selling price of over $1,200 per PC. The average selling price, excluding Apple, was $460 per PC.At WWDC Monday, Cook announced that Apple would migrate to the Arm-based PC over the next two years. The Arm-based SoCs are the same Apple-designed family that drives the iPhone and iPads. A benefit of the Arm-based PC is much lower power for the same performance, which allows either more compute power, extended battery life, sleeker PCs or a combination.Microsoft shares a similar objective to Apple. It wants to move its current PC platform to Arm-based processors that offer better price-performance, constant connectivity and improved architectures for\u00a0real-time\u00a0Matrix applications. Also, it wants Windows to run the Arm-based applications that are currently running on iOS and Android platforms.Microsoft will need to add features to support advanced Heterogeneous Compute architectures that will enable\u00a0Matrix Workloads\u00a0to be run on PCs. The Matrix workloads will include real-time inference AI for virtual reality. photography and video enhancements and the like. Like Apple, Microsoft will make this functionality available on x86 PCs, with lower performance expectations.Based on the Apple and Microsoft strategies, Wikibon has projected two PC scenarios.Figure 2 below shows the Wikibon projection for PC shipments without active support from Apple and Microsoft in an x86-only scenario:Both Apple and Microsoft are significant providers of software and services for their PC platforms, and increasing the shipment of PCs would turn around the expected decline in software licenses and cloud services. This\u00a0outcome is of great importance to both companies, and especially to Microsoft, with its dominance of Windows in the PC market. That takes us to the second scenario.Figure 3 shows the Wikibon projection assuming\u00a0active support from Apple and Microsoft to migrate iOS and Windows to support Arm-based processors. Also, they will help ISVs move the top 10% of applications to run well on Arm-supported OSes, and provide emulation features to enable most applications to work.Apple just announced that Big Sur macOS will fully support the Arm-based PC in 2020, will ship a new high-end x86 PC in 2020. It indicated that the full migration to Big Sur and the Arm-based PC would be complete in 2021. Apple also strongly suggested that macOS would continue\u00a0to support Intel processors\u00a0fully\u00a0for a long time.Microsoft\u2019s objective in supporting Arm is to turn the Windows PC from a declining platform to a volume growth platform, as is shown on the right-hand side of Figure 3. Wikibon believes that Microsoft and other PC software vendors can increase the total available market for OS licenses, application licenses and cloud support services by about 750 million units. If Apple and Microsoft Windows PCs are to have an impact on new areas of growth, such as virtual reality, there needs to be a significant change to the classic PC architecture. Also, the ability to run Arm-based smartphone and tablet software directly on Arm-based PC is a potential game-changer.The reason for this reduction is the disaggregation of the processor industry, with companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. focusing on fabrication and Arm focusing on processor design. This disaggregation has led to faster development cycles, about half of the classic x86 period. Large companies such as Apple, AWS, Google LLC, Nvidia Corp., Microsoft,\u00a0Qualcomm\u00a0Technologies Inc. and even Tesla Inc. have developed their Arm-based processors targeted for their software.Apple and\u00a0Microsoft are moving decisively to Arm-based processors, with higher performance, lower power, lower cost and thinner form factors. New matrix workloads with AI improve photographs, audio, video and usher in virtual reality. The heterogeneous architectures run Matrix workloads two orders of magnitude faster than x86. Both Apple and Microsoft will provide the same Arm-based PC functionality on x86 PCs, with lower performance expectations.Wikibon believes that the Arm-based PC will revitalize the Apple and Microsoft PC platforms and improve user productivityAs a result, they will grow strongly in the second half of this decade.Forgot Password?", "In some ways, it's remarkable that we still predominantly use alphanumeric passwords in 2020, even after tech companies have been trying to kill off that paradigm for years. Many prominent companies are members\u00a0of the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance, an industry association dedicated to creating authentication standards designed to wean the world off passwords.That now includes Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which joined the FIDO Alliance just a few months ago. The company is now inching closer to ditching all those numbers and letters (and special characters).Image source: Apple.TechCrunch reports that Apple is bringing its biometric authentication protocols, Face ID and Touch ID, to the broader web in the next major version of Safari. The Mac maker outlined the new technology during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week.MacBooks now have Touch ID, and Apple is rumored to be adding Face ID to Macs at some point in the future, based on recent patent filings.Web developers can adopt the new authentication methods for their sites, which is based on a web authentication standard developed by FIDO. Apple says it will offer users a \"frictionless experience\" to log in to their favorite sites.Great news! Apple expands support for #FIDO Authentication with Safari 14 (MacOS/iOS)! Websites can use Touch ID / Face ID for secure and frictionless web logins via #WebAuthn API. Great video on how websites can get started: https://t.co/NZ92tEhFaLWhile other competing browsers already utilize the basic application programming interface (API) that FIDO developed, including support for Microsoft Windows Hello facial recognition or fingerprint sensors found on many Android phones, Apple has the potential to really catalyze mainstream adoption for a number of reasons.For starters, Apple's hardware ecosystem is not fragmented, and it can offer far greater levels of integration across hardware, software, and services. The company will also emphasize privacy and security, leaning on the secure enclave inside of iOS devices to keep sensitive data stored locally and winning consumers over. Once consumers are onboard, developers follow.Put simply, Apple has a unique ability to shepherd all of its stakeholders in the same direction while repackaging complex technologies into easy-to-use user experiences.iOS apps have long been able to incorporate Face ID or Touch ID, but this is the first time that those authentication techniques could be applied to the broader web. It's similar to how Apple has been rolling out Apple Pay for the Web over the past few years, which similarly relies on buy-in from third-party developers.The move may even threaten the entire market for password management software, which is expected to grow to over $2 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research. Presumably, Apple plans to also integrate the new authentication methods with \"Sign in with Apple,\" the single sign-on (SSO) service introduced last year that offers greater privacy controls than competing consumer SSO offerings.Being able to log in to third-party sites with a face or finger will further entrench users in Apple's world.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In addition, the two companies combined make up 8.6% of the total S&P 500 index.\u00a0Free cash flow is a very important component of analyzing Apple and Alphabet (along with most financial securities) both on an overall and per share basis. Free cash flow is the truest measure of financial value available to shareholders. It is calculated by taking operating cash flow (cash actually generated by business operations) minus capital expenditures (cash consumed to maintain and grow the business).Apple, with a current enterprise value of $1.5 trillion and free cash flow of $67 billion, is currently trading at a free cash flow to enterprise value of around 22.5. This equates to a free cash flow yield of about 4.4%. Despite a growing percentage of revenue derived from \u2018services\u2019 (partly due to plateaued growth on the hardware side), the outlook for future material free cash flow growth seems to be muted over the next several years.\u00a0With a $25 billion net debt position, stagnant cash flows over the past five years, and that pattern likely to continue over the next couple years, plus COVID-19/regulatory concerns, Apple seems fully valued at best and materially overvalued at worst.\u00a0Alphabet, although a nice performer during the same period, has not compared to the run Apple has had. Since January 2019 Alphabet is up 42.5% and since March 2020 is up roughly 40%.Over the same five-year period we looked at for Apple, Alphabets\u2019 free cash flow increased from $16.1 billion to $29 billion. This represents total annualized free cash flow growth of around 14% since 2015. The share count was constant through the period so free cash flow growth per share was the same 14%.Apple looks vulnerable after its recent incredible stock run-up. The law of large numbers also should kick in with the sheer size of the enterprise. With the current market cap $1.5 trillion, if investors are looking for around an 8% return per year over the next five years, that would bring the projected market cap to roughly $2.2 trillion. That $2.2 trillion market cap would equal the total GDP of Brazil.\u00a0In comparing near-flat free cash flow of Apple and growth of Alphabet, the choice is clear.

The analyst sees a clear path for the Mac maker to become the first $2 trillion company, after Apple's market cap reached $1.5 trillion earlier this month.Here's how Ives thinks Apple gets there.Apple detailed iOS 14 this week during its virtual WWDC keynote. Image source: Apple.Wedbush reiterated an outperform rating on Apple shares and pointed to familiar factors: Momentum in the services segment, the forthcoming 5G iPhones that are expected to drive a massive upgrade cycle, and continued recovery of the business in China.\"We believe during 2021 Apple has strong potential to be the first $2 trillion valuation given the 5G tailwinds and services momentum potential over the coming years,\" Ives wrote. \"In particular, we are seeing a continued demand snapback in China despite some speed bumps and the stage is setting\u00a0for a massive pent up iPhone 12 cycle heading into the Fall in this key region as well as globally.\"For reference, a $425 price target would represent a market cap of about $1.84 trillion, based on the 4.33 billion shares outstanding that Apple currently has. However, the company's aggressive stock buyback program continues to reduce total shares outstanding over time.Incredibly, Ives estimates that Apple's services business is worth around $600 billion to $650 billion -- comparable to Facebook's current market cap of around $675 billion -- based on that segment's increasing significance, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic has created a surge in demand for online entertainment and other digital services as people stay home.That's despite the increasing antitrust risks that Apple's services segment faces, as lawmakers and regulators the world over are heavily scrutinizing the company's App Store policies for potential anticompetitive violations. An adverse outcome from any of those current or potential investigations could threaten to derail that momentum, particularly if Apple is forced to modify some of its policies (instead of simply paying monetary penalties).10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Global shipments of wearables grew 29.7% year over year to 72.6 million in the first quarter of 2020.Earwear shipments accounted for 54.9% of the market and grew 68.3% year over year, followed by Wristband that grew 16.2% during the same period.Per Gartner\u2019s projections, global user spending on wearable devices will increase 22% year over year to $63 billion in 2021. Moreover, according to Mordor Intelligence, the smart wearables market is anticipated to witness CAGR of 19.1% over the 2019-2024 timeframe.Fitness bands are also gaining rapid adoption due to improving capabilities driven by the infusion of AI, ML and IoT technologies. Apple, Fitbit FIT and Jawbone are key beneficiaries of this trend.Other Players in the FrayThe loss of key features like blood oxygen monitoring system and heart rate detection through the light emitters due to various lawsuits could hurt Apple\u2019s competitive position in the wearables market against the likes of Amazon AMZN, Fitbit, Garmin, and Samsung in the long run.Alphabet GOOGL is expected to emerge as the biggest challenger, primarily due to the Fitbit acquisition. The integration of Fitbit devices \u2014 activity trackers, smartwatches, wireless headphones, smart scales \u2014 will expand Alphabet\u2019s technological platform (Android, smartphone, chromecast, smart display, Nest devices).Its Google division is also gaining traction in this particular space with its Wear OS operating system, which can be synchronized with Google Fit and other health apps.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s focus on infusing advanced AI and ML technologies into its platform is a key catalyst. Further, the addition of technologies (via acquisitions & partnerships) from Pebble, Misfit and Fossil is expected to provide Alphabet a competitive edge over Apple.Notably, Charge 4, released in April, is Fitbit\u2019s first tracker after the company was acquired by Google. The latest and advanced fitness tracker comes with GPS and allows users to subscribe to music streaming apps like Spotify. This also includes features from Fitbit Charge 3 that enable better healthcare management with its advanced 24/7 PurePulse heart rate technology and SpO2 sensor.Additionally, the Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s Versa 2 is equipped with smart sleep features like Sleep Score, Smart wake, Sleep Mode and estimated oxygen variation graph, and other advanced health, fitness and smart features.Meanwhile, Garmin\u2019s solid portfolio of smartwatches include vivoactive 4 and 4S GPS, which feature advanced sleep tracking , respiration tracking, Body Battery energy monitoring, women cycle tracking, stress tracking with relax reminders and hydration tracking. These watches also provide abnormal heartrate alerts.Additionally, the company also introduced vivomove 3/3S, vivomove Style and vivomove Luxe, which are well-equipped with health wellness features.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company introduced a GPS smartwatch with AMOLED screen named Venu that provides valuable health insights and is capable of 24/7 health monitoring.In a bid to fight the coronavirus, Amazon recently deployed clear plastic-sleeve shaped like gadgets that give off warning signals when workers violate social-distancing mandate.Samsung is also rapidly penetrating the fitness tracking smartwatch space with its expanding family of Galaxy Watch. Samsung shipped 1.9 million smartwatches in the first quarter of 2020 even as its market share went down from 15% to 14%. Samsung\u2019s smartwatch growth was slowed by the coronavirus lockdown in South Korea and new competition from rivals like Garmin.Diverse initiatives by the abovementioned companies are intensifying competition in this space.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

The stock is already up 25% so far this year, even as the broader market treads water.These impressive gains have investors wondering whether the train has already left the station or if Apple still has room to run. Let's take a look at what's been driving the stock to these lofty heights in an attempt to answer this quintessential investing question: Should you buy Apple stock right now?Image source: Apple.Apple stock initially slumped more than 30% on concerns that the worldwide closure of its retail stores and widespread stay-at-home orders would force consumers to hunker down, hanging on to their phones longer and decimating Apple's results. While those fears were well-founded, there was a silver lining to Apple's dark cloud.The company's increasing focus on services and wearables over the past several years, coupled with its strong online sales channel, gave Apple a lifeline, even as many other retailers struggled with weak demand.Apple reported is fiscal second quarter results in late April, as investors were beginning to get past some of the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic. Apple reported quarterly revenue of $58.3 billion, edging up 1% compared to the year-ago quarter, while earnings of $2.55 per share increased 4%.\u00a0Yet underlying these tepid results were indicators of what the future may hold. The company delivered record quarterly results from Apple retail, powered by strong growth from its online store. It also coaxed a quarterly record out of its wearables, home, and accessories segment, while generating an all-time record from its services segment. This minimized the damage from the pandemic, helping Apple keep its head above water. It also highlights several of the catalysts that will help drive Apple's future growth.Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon in a scene from the Apple TV+ original series The Morning Show. Image source: Apple.One of the more compelling potential drivers for Apple in the near term is the ongoing shift to the next generation of mobile technology, commonly called 5G. Apple decided to forego the tech in last year's iPhone 11 -- even as competitors touted 5G -- because it was only available in a handful of cities. Many believe that the iPhone 12, which is expected to be released later this year, will incorporate the technology. The release is expected to result in a groundswell of demand, which some are calling a \"super cycle.\"Earlier this year, Apple revealed it has an installed base of more than 1.5 billion active devices worldwide, and while the company didn't provide an update for the iPhone, estimates put that number at close to 1 billion. The coming upgrade cycle could result in as many as 350 million iPhone upgrades in the coming year, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, driving Apple stock even higher.\u00a0Another factor that can't be ignored is Apple's relentless share buyback program. Just last week, RBC Capital's Robert Muller highlighted the company's capital allocation plan. \"Apple remains in a league of its own when it comes to share repurchases,\" he said in a note to clients. Muller believes Apple will continue to buy back stock of about $70 billion annually, similar to its recent rate. If that's the case (and history shows it's likely), Apple will produce compounded earnings-per-share growth of 4% -- and that's from the buybacks alone.\u00a0Then there's Apple's services. Over the past four quarters, the segment has generated more than $50 billion in revenue, amounting to nearly 19% of Apple's total sales -- and that could be just the beginning. Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani recently calculated that Apple's services business could double by late 2024, after having doubled over the previous four years. Services is also a higher-margin business, so it will likely boost Apple's bottom line in the process.Image source: Apple.Apple stock isn't the screaming bargain it was just a couple of months ago. The stock currently sells for about 29 times earnings, while the average for the S&P 500\u00a0sits at about 23. Apple is also trading at six times forward sales. These metrics have been driven higher by the stock's impressive recovery since bottoming out in late March.Analysts expect Apple revenue to tread water this year, with sales growing just 1%, though estimates are much more bullish for 2021, with revenue expected to grow more than 12%.\u00a0Should you buy Apple stock right now?I would argue that the answer is an unqualified \"yes.\" While the iPhone still accounts for the lion's share of Apple's revenue (nearly half in the most recent quarter), the company has focused heavily on increasing the contribution from its services business, which now accounts for nearly one-fifth of Apple's sales. Additionally, the company has a laundry list of potential catalysts that could drive the stock higher. Some even believe Apple's market cap could close in at $2 trillion later this year, about 25% higher than its current value.The evidence is clear that Apple's ecosystem is as sticky as ever, as evidenced by the strong growth of its services. Its customers are equally loyal and with the latest line of iPhones just around the corner, the future has never looked brighter for Apple -- or its investors.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Outside of the retired Xserve, they haven\u2019t had any other enterprise networking products servers, they\u2019ve never had an enterprise networking product, though. You might be interested to know that an ex-Apple employee went on to found a company that currently sells enterprise networking gear. Robert Pera, the founder of Ubiquiti, Incworked for Apple in the early 2000s as a Wi-Fi engineer.  \t\t\t(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \t\tAbout Apple @ Work:\u00a0Bradley Chambers has been managing an enterprise IT network since 2009. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise-grade Wi-Fi, 100s of Macs, and 100s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments.While he was at Apple, Robert tested Wi-Fi-based products to ensure they were within the with Federal Communications Commission standards for electromagnetic emissions. Pera found out that that the power sources that Apple\u2019s Wi-Fi devices used to send signals were below FCC limits. Robert thought that boosting their power would increase their range to help reach areas that traditional ISPs didn\u2019t cover. His managers at Apple ignored the idea. He decided to build is own product. After spending a few years working on it during nights and weekends, he set out on his own and formed Ubiquiti.What I find interesting about Ubiquiti is how it could have been Apple\u2019s product line. Imagine if Robert had stayed at Apple and Ubiquiti was part of the Apple enterprise brand? They could have offered a low-cost networking solution for enterprise customers.Looking back at the founding of Ubiquiti, it\u2019s a product line that could have done well with\u00a0PowerSchool\u00a0and would have been very valuable to own today. Even if Apple didn\u2019t want to compete in enterprise networking environments, they could have built a turn-key Wi-Fi solution for K\u201312 schools. That is one area that Google nor Microsoft have a solution for, and Apple could have excelled at it.Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:Apple @ Work is a 9to5Mac series where Bradley Chambers looks at the latest trends and news with how the Mac and iOS are working in enterprise IT environments.Bradley lives in Chattanooga, TN where he manages Apple devices for a private school.\u00a0Everything Apple announced in its WWDC keynotewatchOS 7: Hands-on with Apple Watch sleep tracking", "When it comes to its track record of smartphone innovation, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stands as the market leader. Since its introduction back in 2007, the iPhone has kickstarted a new industry and spawned numerous copycat designs. Thirteen years later, the company is still growing steadily and seeing its share price hit new all-time highs, almost tripling from the level it traded at five years ago.\u00a0The company has built up a strong following of loyal fans who scramble to grab the latest models of iPhones and iPads as soon as they are released. It's uncommon to witness such deep devotion to a technology company, in an era when people are increasingly spoiled for choice among gadgets. Apple has something unique and special going for it that endears people to its products and services.Apple had just concluded its Worldwide Developers Conference, an event held annually to showcase the company's latest technology and new software. CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple will begin using its own ARM-based processors instead of\u00a0Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) chips in its MacBook Pro and iMac computers.\u00a0These new chips will allow Apple to have more control over its chips and align the internal architecture for its computers with that of its iPhones and iPads. Although there may not be any immediate benefits arising from this transition (which will take two years to complete), the company pointed to improved power consumption and better processing power as benefits. That may happen, but it's good to see Apple pivot away from reliance on a third-party vendor and going in-house. This move not only cuts down on overall manufacturing costs but also helps to streamline and improve Apple's supply chain for its iMacs.Over the years, Apple has proven that it can continuously innovate and introduce new features into its products. The once-a-year announcement of new models for its signature iPhone and iPad is met with eager anticipation, and people have come to expect the company to come up with brand new features to enhance its product offerings. Apple also released the Apple Watch back in 2015, and it quickly became one of the world's best-selling wearable devices. This culture of innovation and inventiveness keeps customers coming back for more and encourages repeat purchases from its loyal fan base.For the iPhone 12 that is slated to be released later this year, the expectation is for big changes: a new look and design, plus added functionality. \u00a0For the sixth iteration of the Apple Watch, rumors are swirling about a new stand-alone fitness app that can provide guided workouts for a variety of different activities. Native sleep tracking may also be on the cards, but the battery life for the Apple Watch may need to be ramped up significantly for it to last through the day and night as well. These supposed new features are hotly anticipated, and Apple being at the forefront of such leading innovations makes the company's products all the more attractive to its growing customer base.With iPhone and iPad sales showing inconsistent year-over-year growth in recent years, Apple is now focusing its attention on growing its services division. This is an astute move, since it will reduce Apple's reliance on selling and marketing of products (which suck up significant sums of money each year) and pivot the company toward more subscription-based revenue, which is more stable and also stickier by nature.The services division consists of services such as Apple TV+, Apple Pay, and Apple News. Users spent\u00a0more than half a trillion dollars within Apple's app store in 2019, showcasing just how much money the platform attracts. For the first half of the 2020 fiscal year, Apple reported a 16.7% year-over-year increase in revenue for its services division to $26.1 billion. This division made up 17.4% of total revenue, up from 15.7% during the same period a year ago. This underscores the increasing contribution from services, and over time, this proportion is set to increase even further as Apple releases more subscription-based services. With services commanding more than twice the gross margin of products, this shift should see Apple's margins slowly creeping up over time. {%sfr%}10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But Apple committed a blunder by pricing the iPhone SE at a big premium in India, thanks to duties and taxes. However, the iPhone maker is reportedly looking to set that right by assembling its entry-level device in India itself.Citing sources familiar with the matter, AppleInsider recently reported that Apple could begin assembling the iPhone SE in India.\u00a0The Indian government has been taking steps to invite smartphone manufacturers looking to move their production out of China in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic by offering them production-linked incentives.The government has launched\u00a0a $6.6 billion plan for five global smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) who will be incentivized for locally made devices to the tune of 4% to 6% in cash for the next five years, if they meet certain targets. Apple contractors Foxconn and Wistron already have manufacturing facilities\u00a0in India, with the latter said to be the manufacturing partner for the iPhone SE.So it is not surprising that Apple is looking to ramp up production of its entry-level device in the country, as doing so could help bring down pricing substantially.The iPhone SE is currently priced\u00a0at 42,500 Indian rupees (roughly $561 at the current exchange rate), which is significantly higher than its $399 price tag in the U.S. In fact, the iPhone SE's price in India is one of the highest in dollar terms compared to the rest of the world. If Apple starts manufacturing the device in India, it can avoid the basic customs duty of 20% levied on imported smartphones in addition to a 10% service charge on the import tax.Throw in the production-linked benefits that the Indian government is promising, and there is a chance that Apple could reduce the price of the iPhone SE by as much as one-fourth of its existing price by producing locally in India. That could bring the price of the device to around 32,000 rupees (roughly $425), putting it in the sweet spot of India's booming mid-range smartphone space.According to IDC's\u00a0estimates, sales of smartphones priced between $200 and $500 saw 55.2% annual growth in India last year. The research firm points out that this price segment accounted for 19.3% of total smartphone sales of 152.5 million units in the country in 2019. So, Apple could unlock a huge opportunity by producing smartphones in India. However, this is just one part of the bigger picture.The Indian government is encouraging smartphone manufacturers to shift their supply chains to the country, which will help them avoid import duties on components. This is probably why Apple is now considering making a new smartphone in India as compared to its earlier strategy of selling older models there.\u00a0The iPhone SE's internals are identical to Apple's current flagship -- the iPhone 11 -- to quite some extent, including the A13 Bionic processor. So the anticipated production of the iPhone SE in India means that Apple is probably working toward making its flagship phones there.If that happens, Apple should be able to reduce the price of its flagship offerings in the country. The company struck gold with the price of the iPhone 11 in India last year. This sent the sales charts ringing as Apple's shipments in the country jumped 78% in the first quarter of 2020. However, the weaker rupee and an increase in taxes have led to a jump in the iPhone 11's price of late, which now costs 68,300 rupees ($903 approximately) on Amazon India for the 64 GB model.For comparison, the same model costs $699 in the U.S. Apple could reduce this huge price difference in India by manufacturing locally and improving its prospects in India's booming smartphone space. Cisco estimates\u00a0that smartphone sales in India could increase to 829 million by 2022 as compared to 404.1 million in 2017, recording a compound annual growth rate of 15.5%.The coronavirus pandemic may dent the momentum as smartphone shipments in the first quarter of 2020 increased just 4%. But the long-term picture remains intact, thanks to catalysts such as cheap data, a young\u00a0demographic, and a massive population -- all of which could pave the way for Apple to make a bigger mark in India's booming telecom space.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

WiLAN had a good Q1, generating $3.5 million of adjusted EBITDA on $10.2 million in revenue. This reflects WiLAN's continued ability to generate cash flow even at more modest revenue levels. In terms of a COVID-19 impact to the WiLAN business, in general, license agreements are completed in face-to-face negotiations. However, the team is demonstrating that it can get business done in a work-from-home environment and continues to press forward on this litigation pipeline. WiLAN's licensing activity in the quarter included an agreement with UMC on semiconductor patent from our Polaris portfolio. But the biggest development for Q1 -- or WiLAN in Q1 in early January when it won a second jury verdict against Apple in the [second jury] trial.At our AGM in April, we noted that if there's to be an appeal in the Apple case, and keep in mind, either side can appeal in this verdict, that the appeal decision will be rendered in approximately 24 months' time. Of course, as we said in the past, we are always open to negotiation at any time on a reasonable outcome. With 2 jury verdicts in our favor so far in this trial process, we believe we have a strong position to negotiate from.That's very clear. And then, I mean, I'll ask just for a little bit more specifics to the extent you're able on the current status of the Apple trial, post trial motions. And any more color there given the size of the award and the potential implications would be helpful.And then there's just no telling what that will look like, but that's a timetable that you can kind of, sort of, I would say, pencil in. And then as I indicated, we will have the opportunity as well Apple to launch appeals against what falls out of that judgment. So I think we're kind of in a wait-and-see mode until we hear that judgment, which we -- like I said, we will expect sometime before the end of August.And then on the other -- the WiLAN business outside of Apple, you had mentioned that you were able to execute on some licensing opportunities in -- remotely. Do you -- is it fair to say that there was some impact to your Q1 or will be some to your Q2 results from some potential licensing opportunities slipping to the right?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a buy.The investment bank added Apple to its conviction buy list recently and released a note predicting that the companys stock price will double in the next year. That prediction is based on an evaluation of Apple as a services company. According to Goldman, Apples low earnings multiple (almost 13 times its current revenues) is a result of the markets incorrect assessment of the company as a hardware outfit, according to InvestopediaApples multiple embodies the scars from preceding fallen giants in hardware (Motorola, Nokia, BlackBerry, and HP, to name a few). However, we think Apples business model has less in common with traditional hardware companies, and more in common with companies that monetize mobile users through content and services, the companys note said.The note also cited Apples loyal and wealthy user base as a reason for raised revenues. According to the bank, Apple could earn an additional average revenue of $153 per user, over and above the $467 it already earns from iPhone users through its recently-introduced services, such as Apple Pay and Apple Music.

This analysis will also look to assess whether the CEO is appropriately paid, considering recent earnings growth and investor returns for Apple.  See our latest analysis for Apple  According to our data, Apple Inc. has a market capitalization of US$1.5t, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$12m over the year to September 2019.

We note that\u2019s a decrease of 26% compared to last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$3.0m.  In comparison with other companies in the industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b , the reported median total CEO compensation was US$9.4m. This suggests that Apple remunerates its CEO largely in line with the industry average. What\u2019s more, Tim Cook holds US$300m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.  Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 21% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 79% of the pie. Apple pays out 26% of remuneration in the form of a salary, significantly higher than the industry average. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.  Apple Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 14% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 3.7% over the last year.

(After the subscriber's first year, the commission is reduced to 15%.) Any developer who wants to make money on Apple's iPhone and iPad audience must pay a hefty surcharge for that privilege.       In December 2018, Netflix decided it no longer wanted to give Apple that cut, so it stopped letting people sign up in the app.       \"Apple is a partner but also a dominant platform whose actions force the vast majority of consumers to pay more for third-party apps that Apple arbitrarily defines as 'digital services,' \" said a Tinder spokeswoman. \"We're acutely aware of their power over us.\"       Google-owned YouTube Music also passes on Apple's 30% fee to customers. Apple's App Store prohibits mentioning that a lower fee can be accessed elsewhere, a YouTube spokeswoman said.       Apple's guidelines say developers can't list alternative prices or discourage purchasing through the App Store in their iOS apps. An Apple spokeswoman said that developers are free to promote other pricing outside of the App Store, including on television and billboards.       Google, which operates the Play Store where the majority of Android apps are downloaded in the U.S., does charge up to 30% commissions on in-app transactions it handles. But its policies aren't as ironclad as Apple's. Whereas Apple requires all in-app purchases to go through the tech giant's own billing software, the Play Store allows an exception for companies that host digital content and use their own payment system. As such, Tidal doesn't have to pay any fees to Google.       According to Apple, Amazon is in a program for \"premium video providers\" permitted to use the payment method tied to customers' existing video subscriptions. Two European entertainment companies, Altice One and Canal+, are also in the program. But the move did seem like a concession aimed at getting Amazon Prime Video -- of which Amazon reports over 150 million members world-wide -- to finally work on the Apple TV device.       So while Android holds most of the global smartphone market share -- around 85% on Android vs. 14% on iOS -- Apple has borne the brunt of public and regulatory scrutiny about the App Store's policies and business model.       \"Apple doesn't have a monopoly on smartphones, but it's hard to say that they don't have a monopoly over iOS users,\" said David Barnard, an independent developer who's had three apps in Apple's App Store over the past 12 years. Besides, Apple is historically better than Google at monetizing apps. \"If you want to exist on mobile, you have to go through Apple as a gatekeeper.\"       Apple decides what does and doesn't have to use its billing system. (Yes to games like Candy Crush Saga; no to services like Airbnb and Uber.) That leverage is an issue that was recently brought to the fore when the developers of an email app called Hey prompted a firestorm in the developer community by saying Apple enforces its policies unevenly.       Hey, still in beta, is charging $99 a year for access to its privacy-forward email service. Apple rejected the app on the grounds that it lacked a sign-up (i.e., pay-up) option. The Apple spokeswoman said users should be able to download an app and use it right away. The exemption granted to Netflix, Spotify and others in the \"reader\" category did not apply to Hey.       \"Apple just doubled down on their rejection of Hey's ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue,\" tweeted David Heinemeier Hansson, chief technology officer of Hey developer Basecamp.       Apple eventually approved the Hey app -- Hey bent to the App Store's rules by creating a workaround, in the form of a free trial account that expires after two weeks.       Apple's power to determine which app makers can and can't operate a business is now under official regulatory review. Last week, the European Union launched a probe into whether Apple violated competition laws following a complaint by Spotify, which called the App Store's 30% commission a \"discriminatory tax\" that gives an unfair advantage to Apple's in-house streaming service Apple Music.       The Apple spokeswoman said its fees are used to fund the company's efforts to reduce spam, malware and fraud, as well as its constant review of apps for privacy, security and content purposes. She pointed to the free developer tools Apple provides, such as TestFlight for beta testing, technical support, compilers and Xcode, the software environment that allows developers to build their apps.       Mr. Barnard says he has paid $700,000 in fees to Apple over 12 years -- more than his current net worth -- but agreed there's \"unequivocally\" a benefit to developing for Apple's App Store: \"I didn't have to manage a web store, downloads, payments, taxes, VAT. Apple has taken so much complexity out for businesses and consumers.\"       What's great about the iPhone is, whatever Apple doesn't build itself, someone else builds for it. Imagine an iPhone without Uber, or an iPad without YouTube. But when developers deliberately break their own apps, Apple should at least let them tell their customers why.
