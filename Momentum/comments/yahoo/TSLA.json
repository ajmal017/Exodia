Those comparisons ignore that Ford earns an arbitrage return on most of its debt by lending money to buyers and lessees of Ford products.  Net earnings on Ford Credit's lending operation exceeds net earnings from manufacture, sale and leasing of cars and trucks.\n\nA few comparisons are in order.\n\nIn 2020Q1 Tesla reported the following liabilities\n\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases : $3,217 millions\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion : $10,666 millions\n\nTotal reported debt : $13,883 millions  \n\nFord reported :\n\nCurrent portion of debt in support of manufacturing : $1,609 millions\nCurrent portion of debt in support of Ford Credit : $51,303 millions\n\nLong term portion of debt in support of manufacturing : $28,411 millions\nLong term portion of debt in support of Ford Credit : $85,533 millions.\n\nTesla does not separately call out how much was borrowed to finance leasing.  The best indicator is Tesla reports an asset value of $2,527 millions for leased vehicles.  Presumably, the unpaid / unexpensed portion of money borrowed to finance leased vehicles does not exceed the current asset value of $2,527 millions unless Tesla is upside-down on leased cars.\n\nAs an estimate, $11,356 millions of Tesla's $13,883 millions in debt is in support of manufacturing operations.  That would include money spent to build Gigafactories.\n\nBy itself that is neither bad nor good.  It may be a prudent use of capital if a return is earned on capital assets  which exceeds the cost of capital used to acquire those assets.\n\nMost of Ford's debt earns an arbitrage return by borrowing at lower wholesale rates and lending at higher retail rates to buyers and lessees of Ford products.  Only $30,020 millions of $166,856 millions in debt is used to support manufacturing operations.  The remaining $136,836 millions is not tied up in manufacturing plants and equipment.  Over 80% of Ford's outstanding debt would gradually be extinguished if Ford were to shut down Ford Credit by making no new loans and using revenues from existing loans and leasses to pay down $136 billion in debt.\n\nProportionately Ford has $30 billion in borrowed money tied up in plant and equipment to Tesla's $11 billion in order to produce five to six million units annually.  That is about ten to twelve times the number of cars produced by Tesla in its peak year to date.\n\nFord's use of borrowed capital is more efficient than Tesla's in production of cars and trucks.\n\nTesla reported revenue of $239 million on leasing of cars in 2020Q1 with cost of goods sold of $122 million for a margin of 95.9%.  Using a figure of $2,527 millions of borrowed capital in support of leases that is a return of 4.63% ($117 / $2,527) on borrowed capital.  That appears to be a respectable return as the coupon rate on Tesla's bond borrowings is lower.  It is not reported how much that return is reduced by the portion of SG&A expense attributable to the leasing unit.\n\nFor comparison, in 2020Q1 Ford Credit reported net operating income of $43 million  on revenue of $2,967 millions. Net income from Ford Credit was insufficient to offset Ford's losses on selling cars and trucks.\n\nA year earlier, Ford Credit posted net income of $742 millions on loan revenues of $3,097 millions.   Net income from Ford Credit exceeded net income of $454 million from selling cars and trucks.  Ford Credit uses OPM to earn money for Ford shareholders.  The arbitrage return on borrowed money is comparable to the return earned on deposits at a large bank.\n\nThere is little reason for Ford to shutdown Ford Credit.", "created_at": 1594219780, "followers": 0, "following": 0, "likes": 1, "dislikes": 1, "watchlist_stocks_count": 0, "join_date": 0, "replies": 0, "sentiment": [], "sentiment_analysis": 0.10736171236171237}, "RJVQOLGPB5PHFVY77Q4BLJSRWM": {"body": "Tesla is now bigger than Exxon.

Those comparisons ignore that Ford earns an arbitrage return on most of its debt by lending money to buyers and lessees of Ford products.  Net earnings on Ford Credit's lending operation exceeds net earnings from manufacture, sale and leasing of cars and trucks.\n\nA few comparisons are in order.\n\nIn 2020Q1 Tesla reported the following liabilities\n\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases : $3,217 millions\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion : $10,666 millions\n\nTotal reported debt : $13,883 millions  \n\nFord reported :\n\nCurrent portion of debt in support of manufacturing : $1,609 millions\nCurrent portion of debt in support of Ford Credit : $51,303 millions\n\nLong term portion of debt in support of manufacturing : $28,411 millions\nLong term portion of debt in support of Ford Credit : $85,533 millions.\n\nTesla does not separately call out how much was borrowed to finance leasing.  The best indicator is Tesla reports an asset value of $2,527 millions for leased vehicles.  Presumably, the unpaid / unexpensed portion of money borrowed to finance leased vehicles does not exceed the current asset value of $2,527 millions unless Tesla is upside-down on leased cars.\n\nAs an estimate, $11,356 millions of Tesla's $13,883 millions in debt is in support of manufacturing operations.  That would include money spent to build Gigafactories.\n\nBy itself that is neither bad nor good.  It may be a prudent use of capital if a return is earned on capital assets  which exceeds the cost of capital used to acquire those assets.\n\nMost of Ford's debt earns an arbitrage return by borrowing at lower wholesale rates and lending at higher retail rates to buyers and lessees of Ford products.  Only $30,020 millions of $166,856 millions in debt is used to support manufacturing operations.  The remaining $136,836 millions is not tied up in manufacturing plants and equipment.  Over 80% of Ford's outstanding debt would gradually be extinguished if Ford were to shut down Ford Credit by making no new loans and using revenues from existing loans and leasses to pay down $136 billion in debt.\n\nProportionately Ford has $30 billion in borrowed money tied up in plant and equipment to Tesla's $11 billion in order to produce five to six million units annually.  That is about ten to twelve times the number of cars produced by Tesla in its peak year to date.\n\nFord's use of borrowed capital is more efficient than Tesla's in production of cars and trucks.\n\nTesla reported revenue of $239 million on leasing of cars in 2020Q1 with cost of goods sold of $122 million for a margin of 95.9%.  Using a figure of $2,527 millions of borrowed capital in support of leases that is a return of 4.63% ($117 / $2,527) on borrowed capital.  That appears to be a respectable return as the coupon rate on Tesla's bond borrowings is lower.  It is not reported how much that return is reduced by the portion of SG&A expense attributable to the leasing unit.\n\nFor comparison, in 2020Q1 Ford Credit reported net operating income of $43 million  on revenue of $2,967 millions. Net income from Ford Credit was insufficient to offset Ford's losses on selling cars and trucks.\n\nA year earlier, Ford Credit posted net income of $742 millions on loan revenues of $3,097 millions.   Net income from Ford Credit exceeded net income of $454 million from selling cars and trucks.  Ford Credit uses OPM to earn money for Ford shareholders.

President Trump further says the U.S. is populated with the greatest, kindest, hardest-working people on Earth, and is a great country based on democracy, freedom, justice, and capitalism, that boasts a high-tech industry and innovation that is the envy of the world, and has the best medical system and innovation on the planet, etc.\n\nIn stark contrast, the anarchic BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat Party (funded by multi-billionaire George \"open society\" Soros?) gloomily accuses the U.S. of sitting on despicably stolen land that was discovered by a horribly vile world explorer, and being a shamefully evil country, founded by a bunch of white-trash villainous scumbags, and that to this day, is horribly soaked and saturated with disgusting racists all across the country, with rampant systemic racism throughout the maliciously evil United States of America. Obviously, the anarchic BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat Party of Hypocrites intensely hates the U.S. ..... but desperately wants to lead it.\n\nSo, as you can see, during this election season, there's a slight difference in vision between President Trump and the anarchic BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat Party. Were you able to spot that difference?\n\nIn case you didn't spot the difference, I'll spell it out: The anarchic BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat Party seeks to tear down, Cancel, banish, and Permanently Purge all U.S. freedom, U.S. culture, U.S. democracy, U.S. capitalism, U.S. values, and U.S. history. They want to end America. They say their objective is to replace the torn-down U.S. with their grand vision of the totalitarian BLM/Democrat/Antifa-envisioned Communist utopia, eventually leading to the multi-billionaire George Soros's life-long dream of one huge global \"open society\" with \"no countries ... no possessions\" ... \"no heaven ... and no religion too\" ...

Those comparisons ignore that Ford earns an arbitrage return on most of its debt by lending money to buyers and lessees of Ford products.  Net earnings on Ford Credit's lending operation exceeds net earnings from manufacture, sale and leasing of cars and trucks.\n\nA few comparisons are in order.\n\nIn 2020Q1 Tesla reported the following liabilities\n\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases : $3,217 millions\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion : $10,666 millions\n\nTotal reported debt : $13,883 millions  \n\nFord reported :\n\nCurrent portion of debt in support of manufacturing : $1,609 millions\nCurrent portion of debt in support of Ford Credit : $51,303 millions\n\nLong term portion of debt in support of manufacturing : $28,411 millions\nLong term portion of debt in support of Ford Credit : $85,533 millions.\n\nTesla does not separately call out how much was borrowed to finance leasing.  The best indicator is Tesla reports an asset value of $2,527 millions for leased vehicles.  Presumably, the unpaid / unexpensed portion of money borrowed to finance leased vehicles does not exceed the current asset value of $2,527 millions unless Tesla is upside-down on leased cars.\n\nAs an estimate, $11,356 millions of Tesla's $13,883 millions in debt is in support of manufacturing operations.  That would include money spent to build Gigafactories.\n\nBy itself that is neither bad nor good.  It may be a prudent use of capital if a return is earned on capital assets  which exceeds the cost of capital used to acquire those assets.\n\nMost of Ford's debt earns an arbitrage return by borrowing at lower wholesale rates and lending at higher retail rates to buyers and lessees of Ford products.  Only $30,020 millions of $166,856 millions in debt is used to support manufacturing operations.  The remaining $136,836 millions is not tied up in manufacturing plants and equipment.  Over 80% of Ford's outstanding debt would gradually be extinguished if Ford were to shut down Ford Credit by making no new loans and using revenues from existing loans and leasses to pay down $136 billion in debt.\n\nProportionately Ford has $30 billion in borrowed money tied up in plant and equipment to Tesla's $11 billion in order to produce five to six million units annually.  That is about ten to twelve times the number of cars produced by Tesla in its peak year to date.\n\nFord's use of borrowed capital is more efficient than Tesla's in production of cars and trucks.\n\nTesla reported revenue of $239 million on leasing of cars in 2020Q1 with cost of goods sold of $122 million for a margin of 95.9%.  Using a figure of $2,527 millions of borrowed capital in support of leases that is a return of 4.63% ($117 / $2,527) on borrowed capital.  That appears to be a respectable return as the coupon rate on Tesla's bond borrowings is lower.  It is not reported how much that return is reduced by the portion of SG&A expense attributable to the leasing unit.\n\nFor comparison, in 2020Q1 Ford Credit reported net operating income of $43 million  on revenue of $2,967 millions. Net income from Ford Credit was insufficient to offset Ford's losses on selling cars and trucks.\n\nA year earlier, Ford Credit posted net income of $742 millions on loan revenues of $3,097 millions.   Net income from Ford Credit exceeded net income of $454 million from selling cars and trucks.  Ford Credit uses OPM to earn money for Ford shareholders.  The arbitrage return on borrowed money is comparable to the return earned on deposits at a large bank.\n\nThere is little reason for Ford to shutdown Ford Credit.", "created_at": 1594219780, "followers": 0, "following": 0, "likes": 3, "dislikes": 2, "watchlist_stocks_count": 0, "join_date": 0, "replies": 5, "sentiment": [], "sentiment_analysis": 0.10736171236171237}, "CWTGPPOKDZD6PSLXEO2L35DJIM": {"body": "My Question is who is actually buying at 1400?

I have been trading for over 20 years and a lot of what I was taught 20 years ago just doesn't apply these days. There are so many factors driving up companies like Tesla. The average investor does not look at profitability, charts, technicals, fundamentals, etc.. They look at the future of America and the world. Where are we headed 5 to 10 to 20 years down the road. Day to day things like Covid, unemployment, etc.. don't matter anymore in a market like this. We freaked out on Feb. and March and we now realize that we had no reason to. This virus, like all other viruses, will eventually be dealt with and we will move on back to normal life. \n\nBesides all of that, on a technical level of trading, we have zero commission trades now, which years ago did not exist and would cost anywhere from $5 up to $20 to make a trade. Now we can day trade the same stock 100 times a day with no cost to us. Plus we have the Robinhooders and the millennials that buy into companies like hertz and jc penny and make tons of money and then lose tons of money. 20 years ago, people did not invest in bankrupt companies. Today is a whole new ball game. Tesla might be in a bubble, but it might not burst for a month or a year or 5 years or 10 years or never. Look at Amazon as a pure example of people talking about a bubble. They were saying that back when it was under $1000/share. If people listened to the hysteria of the \"Bubble on Amazon\", and sold, they would have missed out on tripling their value. Tesla is not just an EV car company. It is so much more to the people of the world. It stands for great achievement and smarts and a whole new way of life. People invest in those types of company.
