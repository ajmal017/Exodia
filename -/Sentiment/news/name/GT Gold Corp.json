Joseph Mullin comments: \"While the outbreak of COVID-19 negatively affected our original exploration plans for 2020, the effort to control the spread of the virus in British Columbia by the Province and Tahltan Central Government has been nothing short of remarkable. These efforts have enabled us to expand our modest 2020 exploration program whilst remaining vigilant and adhering to the advice and guidelines regarding ongoing infectious disease risk mitigation and control. Work will be focused at our Castle property in the Moat, Castle East and Castle South target areas at the Company's eastern claim boundary bordering GT Gold Corp's properties. Field work here will seek to resolve open soil geochemical and IP chargeability anomalies along strike from high-grade gold-silver mineralization at Saddle South and the porphyry Cu-Au system at Saddle North. As well, initial field work is proposed for the Sofia porphryry Cu-Au project in the Toodoggone.\u00a0 No work is planned on North ROK (Mabon) deposit or at ROK-Coyote which borders the Red Chris operating mine.\"VANCOUVER, June 9, 2020 /CNW/ -\u00a0COLORADO RESOURCES LTD.
