Three well-known pot stocks that performed especially badly in 2019 were Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), HEXO (NYSE:HEXO), and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY). But are these beaten-down marijuana stocks ready to rebound in 2020?Aurora Cannabis, HEXO, and Tilray performed much worse than other big Canadian cannabis producers last year. Aurora's shares sank close to 60%. HEXO didn't fare much better, with the stock falling more than 50%. Tilray was the biggest loser of the three, with its shares tanking by over 75%.There was one major common denominator behind all three stocks' horrible results in 2019: too few retail cannabis stores in Canada. This lack of an adequate retail infrastructure wasn't as problematic early in the year; pent-up demand for legal recreational marijuana initially led to big sales jumps for Aurora, HEXO, Tilray, and their peers. Later in the year, though, the retail bottleneck began to impact the volume of products that provinces were ordering for their adult-use recreational cannabis markets.It's not surprising that the management teams at Aurora and HEXO pointed the finger at Ontario when their quarterly updates later in 2019 disappointed investors. Tilray's executives didn't single out the province, although CEO Brendan Kennedy stated on the company's third-quarter conference call in November that \"the challenges in the Canadian market are ongoing, with a limited number of retail locations and a supply-demand imbalance.\"But Ontario wasn't the only reason that Aurora, HEXO, and Tilray stocks plunged in 2019. Each faced company-specific problems as well.HEXO also overpromised and underdelivered. CEO Sebastien St-Louis predicted that net revenue would double in Q4 from Q3, but the company didn't come close to achieving that goal. HEXO's CFO departed unexpectedly in October. The company withdrew its fiscal 2020 outlook. And in late December, HEXO added more dilution to the list of reasons why investors soured on the stock.While Aurora and HEXO at least enjoyed a few months of big gains earlier in the year, Tilray lost its steam quickly in 2019. The company routinely missed Wall Street estimates in its quarterly results. The acquisition of Manitoba Harvest, a maker of hemp-based foods, weighed on Tilray's margins. Probably the biggest issue for Tilray, though, was that it started out the year with a lofty valuation that simply wasn't sustainable.Another tailwind is that the Cannabis 2.0 derivatives market will ramp up in earnest in 2020. Aurora, HEXO, and Tilray are offering a range of products in this new market that should boost sales significantly in the new year.My hunch is that these positive factors will spur many investors to jump back on the cannabis bandwagon, leading to solid rebounds for many Canadian marijuana stocks. I suspect that Aurora, HEXO, and Tilray will enjoy nice bounces.", "hexo \u2013 2019 was an extremely tough year for HEXO shareholders. The stock saw highs in April of over $8 only to see it trade currently under $2.\u00a0.2019 was an extremely tough year for HEXO shareholders. The stock saw highs in April of over $8 only to see it trade currently under $2.\u00a0Just last week, on December 26, 2019, HEXO announced that the company would enter into a definitive agreement to sell 14,970,062 shares to institutional investors. The offering price for the shares would be $1.67. This deal was offered at a 14% discount to market prices and raised gross proceeds of $25 million. In addition to the shares the offering also includes warrants to purchase 7,485,032 shares at an exercise price of $2.45 per share.As a result, HEXO fell over 20% to $1.48 when the surprise financing was announced. This shows that the market was not pleased with this surprise announcement as liquidity issues persist.HEXO ended this past quarter with a cash position of $73.5 million.\u00a0Just a few months ago in October HEXO raised $70 million through a direct placement of 8.0% unsecured convertible debt. Those investors included the CEO Sebastien St-Louis and other board members which is nice to see confidence from within the company. There is no doubt that financing concerns are an issue throughout the cannabis industry. Many companies have had to make strong efforts to raise additional capital and clean up their balance sheets, many of these deals resulting in dilution.\u00a0Something that we see as a positive for HEXO was their reduction in operating expenses. In their last quarter, HEXO reduced operating expenses dramatically by 25%, but they still recorded an EBITDA loss of $24.6 million. The company currently has an operating expense base of $35.1 million and net sales of only $14.5 million.If you are looking at HEXO as a possible growth pick for 2020 there are a few things you should consider before purchasing any stock. The company generates 70% of its revenues from Quebec. In Quebec, the cannabis 2.0 products are essentially banned so if you are hoping for a dramatic increase in revenue from that market you should be conservative.\u00a0HEXO still has issues in terms of profitability, and there are many reasons for investors to be cautious. However, if we start to see positive results faster than expected HEXO could see explosive gains for 2020. With that being said, the stock could see further downside if revenues do not pick up or the company can not continue to cut costs. We remain cautiously optimistic about HEXO but emphasize extreme caution.(Disclosure: The author owns share of HEXO)HEXO shares were unchanged in after-hours trading Wednesday.

Andrew Walker | January 6, 2020 | More on:  HEXO HEXO Let\u2019s take a look at HEXO (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) to see if it deserves to be on your contrarian buy list today.HEXO traded at $11 per share near the end of April last year. At the time of writing, investors can pick up the stock for less than $2.The fall from grace has many early HEXO fans scratching their heads, as the company had apparently done all the right things to position itself to be a major player in the cannabis market.HEXO is the leading supplier to Quebec, where it is based, and even has an agreement to run the distribution of Quebec\u2019s online cannabis sales. On the downside, the province just raised the minimum age for cannabis purchases to 21.HEXO partnered with Molson Coors Canada to develop and market cannabis-infused drinks through a new company, Truss. It also secured a strategic interest in a two-million-square-foot facility in Ontario that is serving as a production and distribution hub for a wide range of products.The purchase of Newstrike Brands in 2019 gave HEXO added reach across the country, expanding production capacity and increasing the portfolio of licences to eight provinces.For a while, it appeared HEXO was firing on all cylinders, and the company\u2019s management team had high hopes for fiscal 2020, repeatedly providing revenue guidance of up to $400 million for the year.Unfortunately, orders haven\u2019t materialized as anticipated and HEXO had to scale back its targets in recent months and tighten its belt. The company cut 200 jobs last fall and closed facilities. Insiders had to provide $70 million in loans, and the company just raised another US$25 million through a share sale at a very low price.Investors and lenders are avoiding the stock, and HEXO is at risk of running into a cash flow problem. That\u2019s why the shares are trading at a new 12-month low.Cannabis 2.0 could prove to be a winner for HEXO, but some of the new segments face headwinds.The most promising opportunity likely lies in beverages. Cannabis-infused drinks have the potential to be a big hit, and if they really take off, HEXO should capture a good chunk of the Canadian market through its Truss partnership.The Motley Fool recommends HEXO.

HEXO's acquisition of Newstrike Brands put it on track to be a top-tier marijuana producer, and its penchant for dealmaking appeared to have the company on track for CA$400 million in fiscal 2020 sales (a figure management stood by for much of 2019). Yet, by year's end, HEXO was among the worst performers.Contending with persistent supply issues, HEXO announced in October that it would be idling its Niagara grow campus, acquired when it purchased Newstrike, as well as 200,000 square feet of its 1.3-million-square-foot Gatineau, Quebec, facility. I expect this to reduce the company's peak annual output by roughly a third, from 150,000 kilos to 100,000 kilos. HEXO also eliminated 200 jobs from various departments in order to reduce costs.Just as troubling, St-Louis stated that the company would struggle to reach profitability without gobbling up 20% of Canada's market share, which is something that no marijuana grower looks to be on track to achieve -- at least for the time being. HEXO certainly has little chance at gobbling up market share in the current environment where supply is constrained by regulatory issues.Although HEXO has made moves to substantially reduce its expenses, and presumably its operating losses, the damage to the company's reputation has been done. If things don't turn around quickly, HEXO could find itself delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (it's only about $0.50 above the minimum share price for continued listing), at which point I believe St-Louis would be shown the door.", "  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)", "Lagging shares were Hexo Corp., down 5.3 per cent, Exchange Income Corp., down 3.2 per cent, and ARC Resources Ltd., lower by 3.0 per cent.Lagging shares were Hexo Corp., down 5.3 per cent, Exchange Income Corp., down 3.2 per cent, and ARC Resources Ltd., lower by 3.0 per cent.", "* Hexo Corp fell 3.7%, the most on the TSX, while the second biggest decliner was Seven Generations Energy , down 2.4%.* Hexo Corp fell 3.7%, the most on the TSX, while the second biggest decliner was Seven Generations Energy , down 2.4%.", "Last month, Molson Coors also started testing La Colombe Hard Cold Brew Coffee, with an ABV\u00a0of 4.2%.

HEXO (NYSE:HEXO) is a prime example of a stock that's fallen heavily and that may still be too expensive. It was one of those underperforming pot stocks that fell a whopping 70% in 2019, far below the Life Sciences ETF and what its peers averaged. While the temptation may be to point to HEXO's low price-to-book multiple of 0.7 and say that it's a cheap buy, it's just not that simple. Writedowns aren't uncommon in the industry and the value of what's on the books for many of these cannabis companies can be questionable at best.Last month, HEXO released its year-end results. Not only did the company have fair-value gains on inventory and biological assets, but it also incurred an impairment loss totaling 19 million Canadian dollars during the year. The amount of noise on the company's financials makes it difficult to assess what the true value of HEXO's assets are today, and so if the stock is trading below book value, that may not necessarily mean that it's undervalued. Aurora Cannabis, for instance, trades at just 0.6 times its book value and investors aren't rushing out to buy shares of the company, either.Pot stocks have been overvalued for so long and by so much that it's hard to tell what a reasonable multiple looks like anymore. HEXO's price-to-sales multiple of nine looks like it's a steal of a deal compared to its peers -- Aurora trades at nearly 10 times its sales --\u00a0but once you look at other growth stocks, that isn't the case. Amazon.com, a stock that's no stranger to high valuations, trades at only 3.5 times its sales.HEXO is much cheaper than it was a year ago, but that's not much of a benchmark for investors to use.Cannabis 2.0 sales will play a significant role in the industry's growth, but vaping-related illnesses could weigh down those results this year. And HEXO knows all too well how disappointing sales results can negatively impact a stock's price.", "Quebec-based\u00a0HEXO\u00a0(NYSE:HEXO) isn't exactly a household name like the other company's on this list, but the\u00a0200 jobs across various departments\u00a0that it's cutting is notable given that HEXO is a\u00a0marijuana stock!The North American cannabis industry has been among the most robust job creators in recent years, especially with Canada legalizing recreational cannabis and commencing sales in October 2018. However, HEXO and its peers have been clobbered by Health Canada's inability to approve cultivation and sales licensing applications in a timely manner, and Ontario slow-stepping the licensing of physical dispensaries. In simple terms, pot growers can't get their product in front of consumers, and many are having to realign production and costs because of this.Not only is HEXO planning to eliminate 200 jobs, but it'll also be halting cultivation at the Niagara facility, which was acquired when it purchased Newstrike Brands earlier this year, and idling 200,000 square feet of growing space at its flagship Gatineau facility. Suffice it to say, the green rush has suddenly fizzled out in Canada.", "The deal comes at a time when cannabis companies are struggling to raise capital. Last month, Quebec-based licensed producer Hexo suffered a dramatic decline in the value of its own stock after selling new shares at what one analyst called a \u201cmassive\u201d discount.

This is especially true of Quebec-based HEXO (NYSE:HEXO), which shed 54% of its value in 2019 and lost more than 80% from its closing high in late April.But is a more than halving of HEXO's share price a reason for investors to buy into this growth story in 2020? Don't bet on it.On paper, HEXO would appear to offer a lot of value for investors. For one, it's a major producer, with at least 150,000 kilos of peak production capacity at its disposal when fully operational. Having so much output should lead to per-gram production costs that are below the industry average, as well as make it a popular company with which to forge supply deals.Speaking of which, HEXO is the grower behind the largest provincial supply deal to date: a 200,000-kilo, five-year agreement with its home province of Quebec. This deal, presumably, accounts for a third or more of HEXO's production over the next five years and provides some level of cash flow certainty that most other pot growers don't have.HEXO has also been a stud in the dealmaking department. The company wound up acquiring Newstrike Brands to bolster its production and has worked out a two-year agreement with The Valens Company\u00a0to have an aggregate of 80,000 kilos of hemp and cannabis biomass processed for resins and distillates that'll be used in derivatives. As a reminder, HEXO has more than 600,000 square feet set aside solely for processing and manufacturing.It also formed a joint venture\u00a0(known as Truss) with Molson Coors Brewing\u00a0in 2018 that recently launched a line of cannabis-infused nonalcoholic beverages. HEXO has gone all-in on high-margin derivatives, and has eagerly awaited the December 2019 launch of these alternative consumption products.One pretty notable problem for HEXO, and the entire pot industry for that matter, is the persistent supply issues throughout Canada. While these problems are fixable, they're not going to be resolved overnight. Regulatory agency Health Canada will take numerous quarters to work through its cultivation and sales licensing backlog. And Ontario is only now transitioning away from its ineffective lottery system for dispensary licenses, meaning the ramp-up in legal sales channels in the country's most populous province will remain slow.For HEXO, this slow ramp-up in sales means ongoing losses. Having previously touted fiscal 2020 sales of 400 million Canadian dollars ($308 million), HEXO completely pulled the plug on this prognostication and announced production and job cuts instead during the fourth quarter.In an effort to better align output and expenses with current market conditions, HEXO is planning to idle its Niagara grow farm, acquired via the Newstrike deal, as well as halt cultivation on 200,000 square feet at its flagship Gatineau facility. By my estimation, these moves reduce the company's peak annual output by about a third, or 50,000 kilos. Though this should shrink the company's operating losses, it also means it won't be anywhere near operating efficiency.It's also worth pointing out that HEXO has invested a lot of money and time into high-margin derivatives. But its \"return\" for these investments has so far been a delayed launch of alternative pot products and the expectation of tough competition, especially in the Canadian beverage space.Perhaps most concerning is that HEXO ended its most recent quarter with less than CA$55 million in cash and cash equivalents, not including CA$18.8 million in restricted cash. HEXO did raise $25 million (that's in U.S. dollars) in December by selling its common stock at a substantial discount to its previous day's closing price, but its cash position remains worrisome with the industry facing as many near-term challenges as it currently is.\u00a0Although this is not a cannabis stock that investors should consider chasing in 2020, it's not out of the question that its situation improves. HEXO could prove me wrong if a couple of things go its way this year.For instance, all eyes are going to be on Ontario following its move to a more traditional dispensary licensing system. The province believes it can increase its number of open dispensaries to 250 by year's end, up from just 24 in October 2019. If Ontario regulators can outpace their own projections and find a way to get legal-channel product in front of consumers, then HEXO's sales (and those of its peers) should surpass substantially reduced expectations.With HEXO also making hard cutbacks now, including 200 job cuts across numerous divisions, it's possible that the company's operating cash flow could prove better than expected in 2020. Again, with cash on hand being a clear concern among investors, an improvement in operating cash flow (not necessarily bottom-line losses) would probably be enough to inspire more confidence in management.Nevertheless, I'm expecting HEXO's obstacles to outnumber its opportunities in 2020, making it a stock that investors would be best off watching from the safety of the sidelines.", "It is now a well-established fact that 2019 was a disappointing year for cannabis stocks as the sector suffered from a range of structural issues, and those issues still exist.

While no cannabis stock was immune from the market spike and crash of 2019, Hexo\u2019s situation is being compounded by a bottlenecked Canadian retail market.Legal edibles, beverages, derivatives and vapes are finally beginning to hit the shelves in Canada this month. But questions remain: How big of a piece is HEXO going to get from that, and how soon?In calendar Q1 2018, 4.18 million Canadians ages 15 and older used cannabis. By Q3 2019, that number expanded to nearly 5.2 million. Meanwhile, HEXO\u2019s year-over-year growth rate in the trailing three quarters dropped from 27% to 14%.Much of Hexo\u2019s success is pending on how soon the Canadian government can loosen the reins on this hodgepodge retail strategy.\u00a0\u00a0HEXO stock kicked off the first trading day of 2020 nearly 16% below its $1.96 closing price of Dec. 24. On top of that, Hexo stock is down more than 80% since the beginning of May 2019, leaving many investors to wonder if it\u2019s finally hit bottom.And just last week the company closed its registered direct offering, under which the Hexo sold 15 million common shares at $1.67 per share, for gross proceeds of $25 million. It also issued 5-year warrants to purchase approximately 7.5 million shares at $2.45.But these are the types of moves that have investors growing weary on the cannabis industry. While nearly all of Hexo\u2019s peers have resorted to raising cash through equity offerings, investors usually would rather not see companies pursue dilutive measures to continue their growth strategies.HEXO Corp. (HEXO) was trading at $1.45 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $0.06 (+4.32%). Year-to-date, HEXO has declined N/A%, versus a 22.87% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.HEXO Corp.

Of course, the result after those updates was a downturn in shares. But now that the dust has settled, Hexo has both money for operations and updated financial statements. Now we see shares heading back up. As of January 9th\u2019s early afternoon high, HEXO stock already broke above $1.50 a share.

There were winners, like AltaGas Canada (TSX:ACI), and a handful of losers that includes\u00a0Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO). The two companies have contrasting turnouts last year that merit investor attention.Investors were happy to see Hexo leap-frog from $4.82 in December 2018 to $9.20 in mid-March 2019. By the end of April in the same year, the stock was trading at $11.11, or an astonishing 130.5% year-to-date gain. But since then, the weed stock slowly lost its lustre.As of this writing, you can purchase Hexo at $2.05 per share, which is 448.5% lower than its 52-week high. Just like the other prominent industry players, Hexo has nothing to show but mounting losses.The $23.3 million net loss in the fiscal year 2018 increased to $81.5 million in the fiscal year 2019. In the fiscal year 2020, the net loss estimate is 39% worse. As we begin 2020, analysts believe that Hexo is running out of time before it completely disappears from investors\u2019 radars.A day after Christmas, Hexo announced that institutional investors would buy shares at a 14% discount to its market price. The company received $25 million from the sale of about 15 million shares. The move isn\u2019t a show of stability and growth. It only gives the impression that the future of Hexo is very uncertain.This cannabis company is banking on two things \u2014 Cannabis 2.0 and the joint venture with Molson Coors. Unless something spectacular happens this year, Hexo might be in danger of being delisted. Some analysts think that Hexo is only biding time before declaring bankruptcy eventually.The performances of the utility stock and the weed stock in 2019 are contrasting tales. AltaGas Canada remains a viable investment option. It\u2019s likely to attract more investors this year. However, Hexo is racing against time.

Andrew Walker | January 13, 2020 | More on:  HEXO HEXO HEXO (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) has really taken a hit, falling from $11 per share last April to a below $2. At the time of writing HEXO trades at $1.80 and has a market capitalization of about $450 million.Let\u2019s take a look the reasons for the rout and try to determine whether HEXO deserves to be a contrarian buy for your portfolio today.HEXO\u2019s trouble began with its acquisition of Newstrike Brands in the first part of 2019. The deal was initially viewed as positive for HEXO as it expanded the company\u2019s licensing reach to eight provinces and added important production capacity and new brands to the portfolio.At the time of the deal, HEXO said fiscal 2020 revenue could hit $400 million. In June, the company maintained the optimistic guidance, even saying that it expected its fiscal Q4 2019 revenue, which covered the three months that ended July 31, to be close to $26 million, or about double the previous quarter.In October, the management team stepped back the guidance and painted a very different outlook for the 2020 fiscal year. HEXO cut 200 jobs and shut down a former Newstrike production site. When the fiscal Q4 2019 results actually came out, net revenue was just $15.4 million.HEXO recently raised US$25 million through a share issue at US$1.67 per share. This followed a $70 million loan provided to the company by a group that primarily consisted of HEXO executives and board members.Given the ongoing high level of cash burn, investors should be careful. Revenue would have to pick up considerably to get the company to profitability and enable HEXO to start to attract new investors.The recent launch of the edibles and drinks market could provide the revenue surge HEXO needs, but the early indication is that the market is adopting a wait-and-see approach.The Motley Fool recommends HEXO.

The stock has lost over 80% since April 2019 and has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the cannabis sector since the start of 2019.But we know that the optimism surrounding Cannabis 2.0 coupled with the rollout of retail stores in Ontario will hold pot companies in good stead. Further, the decimation witnessed last year has resulted in lower valuations. Hexo is trading at a market cap of $540 million, or 6.6 times forward sales, which might be considered attractive.Hexo is one of the top pot companies in Canada. It wants to become a market leader in the adult-use cannabis space with brands such as Hexo, UP, Original Stash, and \u201cpowered by Hexo.\u201d The company claims to have the lowest-cost production centres in Canada with a broad distribution network across 10 provinces. Hexo has invested heavily in research to enhance product offerings and customer experiences and has partnerships with global CPG companies.Hexo is the first to launch a cannabis oil sublingual spray. It is the first licensed producer (LP) in Canada to join the Food & Consumer Products of Canada, which is the country\u2019s largest association representing this industry. Hexo is also the first LP to obtain Kosher certification and partner with a firm in the plant tissue culture space.Hexo has focused on new product offerings as well as leveraging data analytics for decision making to drive top-line growth. As most cannabis companies, including Hexo, are struggling with low profit margins, it is now looking to streamline the supply chain and automate business processes to improve the bottom line.To achieve its spending targets, Hexo has realigned operating expenses with near-term revenue expectations. Another strategy has been the company\u2019s focus on opening facilities in provinces that have a cost advantage.Hexo launched a low-cost product known as Original Stash and is priced to compete with Canada\u2019s illegal market, which still accounts for close to 40% of the total market.Hexo is expected to launch in the United States in 2020. According to Hexo\u2019s presentation, the North American market for cannabis-infused beverages will reach $1.56 billion this year. The global cannabis-infused beverage market is valued at $5.04 billion.The company has access to 98% of Canada\u2019s population due to its vast distribution network. It has a 33% market share in Quebec, which is the second-largest province in the country. Hexo\u2019s partnership with Molson Coors will help it gain significant traction in the cannabis-infused beverage market.We can see that Hexo, like so many other players, is banking on future growth and investing heavily in capital expenditures.

Between releasing disappointing sales numbers, pulling its forecast for fiscal 2020, and watching its CFO resign after less than a year on the job, the company has seen its share of bad press over the past 12 months. HEXO's biggest problem, though, could be related to cash flow, and there's growing evidence that it may be running low on its most important and most liquid asset.On Dec. 26, HEXO's stock plummeted 22% when investors learned the company would be issuing 15 million additional shares in order to raise $25 million. That meant the offering price would be just $1.67 per share, well below the $1.96 at which HEXO's stock closed the previous day. In addition, 7.5 million warrants would be available for investors to purchase at $2.45 per share. The warrants are available to be exercised over a five-year term.That was bad news for investors, as the share issue would dilute existing shareholders of the company, effectively devaluing the stock. Typically, companies prefer to issue shares when the stock is high and they can obtain a higher offering price. That wasn't the case with HEXO. Prior to the announcement, its shares had declined 43% since the beginning of the year, performing even worse than the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, which was down around 36% over the same period.In the press release announcing the share issue, HEXO said it \"expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including funding the Company's research and development to further advance the Company's innovation strategies.\"As of Oct. 31, 2019, HEXO had 41 million Canadian dollars on its books in cash and cash equivalents. That's down more than CA$72 million from the CA$114 million in cash it had on hand as of July 31, 2019. Over the course of that time, HEXO spent CA$34 million on its operating activities and another CA$37 million to fund its investing activities, including the purchase of property, plant, and equipment.All signs point to one conclusion: HEXO is in trouble. While the company can turn things around and slash costs to free up cash flow, its current financial position makes the stock a very risky buy -- one investors are likely better off steering clear of. Marijuana stocks\u00a0are continuing to decline in value, and HEXO is among the worst of them.Until HEXO can start generating positive cash flow from its operations, investors should stay away from its stock, as it's likely to continue to drop in value.", "Among the stocks in the Healthcare index, Aurora Cannabis (ACB.TO) gained 5.4%, Hexo Corp (HEXO.TO) advanced nearly 4%, Knight Therapeutics (GUD.TO) advanced 2.3% and Canopy Growth Corporation (WEED.TO) was up by about 1.4%.Among the stocks in the Healthcare index, Aurora Cannabis (ACB.TO) gained 5.4%, Hexo Corp (HEXO.TO) advanced nearly 4%, Knight Therapeutics (GUD.TO) advanced 2.3% and Canopy Growth Corporation (WEED.TO) was up by about 1.4%.", "  FILE \u2013 A worker inspects cannabis plants growing in a greenhouse at the Hexo Corp. facility in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, on Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018.

Wall Street is now counting on HEXO to lose $0.10 Canadian per share in 2021, down from an estimated CA$0.13 per share profit just three months ago.As with all Canadian growers, HEXO has been bottlenecked by supply issues. The inability of Ontario to effectively open retail stores has allowed black market producers to thrive. For HEXO, this has meant the need to drastically cut production and expenses. The company has completely idled its Niagara grow farm, acquired via the Newstrike Brands purchase, and plans to idle 200,000 square feet of its 1.3-million-square-foot Gatineau campus. My guess is this reduces HEXO's peak annual production potential by a third.The company is also one of a small handful of cannabis stocks to announce job cuts.

In addition to that, there are other factors that need to be considered, as well. The company has been quite relentless in its zeal to tie up deals.While HEXO boasts of production capabilities of 150,000 kilos per year, it has also signed a five-year supply agreement with its home province of Quebec to supply 200,000 kilos of cannabis. The acquisition of Newstrike Brands and the extraction deal with Valens (TSXV:VLNS) (OTCQX:VLNCF) are also being seen as major positives.Lastly, HEXO launched a cannabis beverage joint venture named Truss with Molson Coors Beverages (NYSE:TAP), which could help the company find a foothold in the cannabis derivatives space. However, it should be noted that despite investing a lot in derivatives, the company has still not seen any return on it.HEXO has also had to idle one of its plants due to current market conditions.

In financial statements analyzed by MarketWatch, the company appears to add up each stock option\u2019s remaining life to arrive at the total weighted average of all the options outstanding in a given quarter.That the company\u2019s financial accounting has been adding up the amount of remaining time versus arriving at an average suggests that either the remaining life of the options or the figure given as the average value may be incorrect. Hexo is required to disclose the amount of stock reserved for options, including the correct terms and amounts, according to International Financial Reporting Standards.The apparent issue first appeared in Hexo\u2019s third-quarter interim financial statements in fiscal 2017 and continued through the company\u2019s first-quarter results in fiscal 2020 \u2014 including two sets of audited financial statements \u2014 according to a MarketWatch analysis of Hexo filings. Over the past year, Hexo has employed three chief financial officers.Three of the quarterly filings and one annual audited filing did not include the total weighted average of employee stock options\u2019 lifetime. Hexo did not respond to requests for comment.Hexo recently restated its first-fiscal-quarter results in a filing with Canadian regulators on Dec. 31. The restatement corrected an error in how the company calculated its deferred tax liabilities and the value of its cannabis trim inventory, but the apparent options issue is present.Ed Chaplin served as Hexo CFO for about four years and resigned in May. The company appointed Stephen Burwash to serve as interim CFO until it tapped Michael Monahan for the position at the end of May. Monahan stepped down on Oct. 7 and was replaced by Burwash.Taking into account the restated results for the first fiscal quarter, Hexo reported losses of C$60 million, which amounts to 23 cents a share, on net revenue of C$14.5 million.

For instance, the pot grower teamed up with alcoholic beverage maker Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP)\u00a0in 2018, and out of this partnership was born a joint venture, dubbed Truss Beverages. HEXO is looking to make a dent in the potentially lucrative cannabis derivative market in Canada via this joint venture.Through its acquisition of Newstrike Brands for 263 million Canadian dollars (about $201 million) in March 2019, HEXO was able to increase its production capacity. With a projected peak output of about 150,000 kilograms per year, HEXO now ranks in the top 10 pot growers in Canada by production capacity.Furthermore, HEXO holds the leading market share in the adult-use cannabis market in Quebec, which is the second-largest Canadian province by population. Despite these advantages, HEXO -- which saw its shares plunge by 53.6% last year -- shouldn't be on the list of cannabis stocks you want to buy. Here's why.\u00a0Last year, HEXO announced two rounds of fundraising within a mere two months. First, in late October, the company announced it would be raising CA$70 million (about $53 million) by issuing convertible debentures. This round of fundraising closed in early December. Then, in late December, HEXO announced it would be raising $25 million by issuing new shares, and this round of fundraising closed on Jan. 2, 2020.\u00a0It just announced another round of shares\u00a0on Jan. 17, to the tune of $20 million. These dilutive rounds of financing make HEXO's stock less attractive.\u00a0On Oct. 10, 2019, HEXO released an update with preliminary results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2019.\u00a0While these preliminary results were disappointing, that wasn't the biggest story. In this update, the company mentioned several problems it was encountering in the Canadian cannabis market, including a slow rollout of retail cannabis stores, regulatory uncertainty, and \"signs of pricing pressure.\"HEXO withdrew its revenue guidance for its 2020 fiscal year. The company initially promised investors revenue in excess of 400 million Canadian dollars ($306 million),\u00a0but \"given the uncertainties in the marketplace,\" HEXO felt it could no longer deliver on that promise. Naturally, investors weren't pleased, and the company's shares plunged by 21% after it released this update.\u00a0Note that for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2019, HEXO recorded net revenue of CA$15 million ($12 million) -- lower than the consensus analyst estimates -- and the company recorded a total net loss of CA$44.7 million ($34.2 million).\u00a0HEXO didn't perform much better during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2020. The company's net revenue was CA$14.5 (about $11 million), and its total net loss was CA$60 million ($46 million).HEXO's poor financial results and its decision to withdraw its guidance for its fiscal year 2020 aren't good signs.HEXO could benefit from several tailwinds. The province of Ontario -- the largest one by population -- will be opening more retail cannabis stores. This is because the government will be making some changes to the process of applying for retail cannabis licenses. For instance, while there was previously a cap on the number of retail cannabis stores allowed in Ontario, that cap will be removed.HEXO could also benefit from the cannabis derivative market, thanks to its partnership with Molson Coors. Even taking these factors into account, however, there seems to be too much stacked against HEXO at the moment, and for that reason, the cannabis company is better avoided.\u00a010 stocks we like better than HEXO Corp.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Canopy and Aurora denied the allegations in brief statements, while Hexo said only its lawyers are reviewing the claims.Hexo, based in Gatineau, Que., is accused of failing to tell investors that it was inflating its revenue figures through a process called channel-stuffing, which involves sending retailers more products than they are able to sell.\u00a0A court filing\u00a0alleges Hexo didn't tell investors its reported cannabis inventory was misstated and that it was growing pot in an Ontario facility not properly licensed by Health Canada.A class-action complaint filed with a New York court says when Hexo announced in March\u00a02019 it was buying rival Newstrike Brands, the company said it was acquiring Newstrike's four production facilities. It also said it was \"committing to achieving over $400 million in net revenue in 2020.\"But by October, the company withdrew that commitment after projecting its net revenue for 2019 would hit between\u00a0$46.5 million\u00a0and\u00a0$48.5 million.

They also represent two distinct ways to play the Canadian cannabis space. While much of the momentum of the marijuana market has diminished post-legalization, there could still be upside in this beaten-up sector: firstly by backing the strongest player and secondly by betting on a takeover.While Canopy is an early market leader, HEXO is among the most turbulent of Canadian pot stocks, with huge share price fluctuations and a loss of 67% on the markets in the last 12 months. HEXO finished last week down by 9%.The plunge comes after HEXO\u2019s proposal to float and sell 12 million shares at a knock-down price in part to fund working capital and R&D. Up to this point, HEXO stock had been rallying last week with +20% gains.HEXO is significantly discounted and offers new investors a two-tiered contrarian play: on the one hand, the HEXO brand is strong and could come out of the muddy cannabis battles as a dominant leader. On the other hand, the company could be bought out by a bigger outfit. Either way, HEXO is cheap enough for a speculative play with potential for surprise upside.HEXO is still a key contrarian play on extreme value with the outside chance of a takeover bid, which could net investors some tantalizing upside if such an event is timed right. Canopy, in the meantime, is still on track to lead in the legal cannabis space, with strong branding, a defensively substantial market cap, and key international reach.Fool contributor Victoria Hetherington has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The cannabis industry was already struggling with Curaleaf\u2019s regulation scandal news in July. In October, the sector started declining more when Hexo announced that its CFO resigned. To make matters worse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch double downgraded its stock and estimated that the company would cut its outlook for 2020. Later, Hexo withdrew its fiscal 2020 outlook due to various headwinds. The stock lost 70% of its stock value in 2019. The shares on the NYSE declined from $5.26 to $1.29 by the end of 2019. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s happening with the company and its stock this year.On January 17, Hexo announced a direct offering to sell 11,976,048 of its common shares at an offering price of $1.67 per share. The company stated that the gross proceeds from the offering would be around $20 million before deducting fees and other expenses. Hexo also issued investors warrants to purchase 5,988,024 common shares of the company over a period of five years. The warrant will allow investors to purchase a common share of the stock for $2.45.\u00a0The company announced the completion of the offering on Wednesday.Hexo announced a direct offering for the second time. The first offering was in December 2019 when it issued 14,970,062 common shares for $1.67 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were $25.0 million before fees and expenses. Also, the company issued investors warrants to purchase 7,485,032 common shares over a five-year term for $2.45 per share.The main intention of a direct offering is to raise additional financing. Hexo has been struggling due to negative profitability in the last reported quarter. The company reported a negative EBITDA of 24.6 million Canadian dollars. Hexo also reported a negative EBITDA in all four of the quarters in fiscal 2019. However, analysts don\u2019t think that this method of raising capital is wise. Some analysts think that raising capital through direct offering \u201cis not normally done from a position of strength.\u201dFor the second quarter of fiscal 2020, analysts expect Hexo\u2019s revenue to grow 25.5% YoY (year-over-year) to 16.8 million Canadian dollars. For the third and fourth quarters, the revenue could be around 20.6 million and 26.6 million Canadian dollars, respectively.Sequentially, analysts expect HEXO to report a lower EBITDA loss in the second quarter. However, the company could still report an EBITDA loss of 14.6 million Canadian dollars in the second quarter. The damage could eventually tone down over the third and fourth quarters. Hexo could report an EBITDA of -12.3 million and -9.1 million in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.Analysts lowered their estimates in January. For fiscal 2020, Hexo could report revenue growth of 70.6% YoY to 81.1 million Canadian dollars. The total EBITDA loss for the year could be around 57.1 million Canadian dollars.Will Hexo continue to struggle in 2020 or will Cannabis 2.0 save it? The answer depends on many factors. Most cannabis stocks are on the verge of crumbling. However, 2020 could bring them back up. Canada legalized vapes, edibles, and concentrates last year. Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC)(TSE:WEED), Aphria (NYSE:APHA), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), and Hexo ramped up their production. All of them have come up with their production line for Cannabis 2.0 products. Hexo announced its beverage portfolio along with Molson Coors. The companies and analysts expect the revenue to surge this year due to the high demand for edibles and beverage products.Currently, 15 analysts cover Hexo stock. Among the analysts, six recommend a \u201chold,\u201d five recommend a \u201csell,\u201d one recommends a \u201cstrong sell,\u201d and three recommend a \u201cbuy.\u201d The average target price on the stock is 2.6 Canadian dollars, which shows a 37% upside potential for the next 12 months.Hexo lost a considerable amount of its stock value in 2019. In 2020, the shares have fallen 10.0% YTD (year-to-date). Meanwhile, OrganiGram has been soaring. The stock has gained 19.1% YTD after its strong first-quarter results. Canopy Growth stock has risen 14.3%, while Aurora Cannabis stock has fallen 5.5%. Aurora Cannabis is also struggling due to lower profitability and a rising debt burden. The company cut down its expansion plans to save funds.Hexo closed with a loss of 4.0% on Wednesday.

Investors facing massive dilution have to question the wisdom of investing in a company with multiple equity raises with the stock plunging below $2. With the ongoing operating losses, one has to wonder whether the company won\u2019t need to raise even more funds.Since the fateful warning on October 10, 2019, HEXO has raised ~$100 million via three capital raises.HEXO had originally forecast doubling of revenues, but the sales gains never materialized. The company had an original FY20 sales guidance of C$400 million, but analysts are now down near $60 million. The latest analyst estimates only have sales growing to top $125 million in FY21 (ending July).The problem facing HEXO and most Canadians is that sales estimates have far missed original targets. The companies spent on facilities and built up operations for a revenue base of up to double the current sales levels.The amount of retail stores in the key provinces of Ontario and Quebec are only ~60 in mid-January. This store issue will slowly resolve over the course of 2020, but a company like HEXO needs the cash to fund growth initiatives now and can\u2019t wait another year for a sales rebound.In the FQ1 quarter ending October 31, HEXO ended the quarter with sales of only C$14.5 million while generating an incredibly large adjusted EBITDA loss of C$24.6 million. The loss was a slight improvement from the prior quarter, but the cannabis company remains far in the red, hence the constant capital raises when the opportunity exists.The company even cut operating expenses during the quarter sequentially by 25%, yet total expenses were still C$35.1 million. HEXO had C$73.5 million of cash on hand at quarter end, but the company also projected spending another C$100 million on capex for the year.Analysts don\u2019t have HEXO reaching the quarterly sales levels to top the current expense levels for well over a year from now. The company has the additional benefit of the cannabis beverage joint venture with Molson Coors (TAP) that won\u2019t be consolidated on the income statement, but the company needs to reduce the cash burn here before investors can focus on those benefits.Dilution will continue to be an issue for investors as the company continues to sort itself out. Desjardins analyst John Chu opined, \"Following an C $800m base shelf prospectus in November 2018, we could see more financings going forward. HEXO recognizes the cannabis environment has changed dramatically and access to capital has become very difficult. Consequently, if investors are willing to invest meaningfully in the company at terms it finds acceptable, the company will consider it. HEXO also indicated to us that its ATM should commence around January 22, 2020 (recall that Aurora had raised ~C$165m through its ATM in ~4\u20135 months).\"Overall, Wall Street is not convinced that HEXO is worth the risk. Based on 12 analysts tracked by TipRanks in the last 3 months, only 2 say Buy, 5 say Hold, and 5 recommend Sell. However, the 12-month average price target stands at $2.17, marking over 50% upside from where the stock is currently trading. (See HEXO stock analysis on TipRanks)The key investor takeaway is that HEXO has a lot of positive catalysts to play out in 2020, but the company needs to reorganize the firm to reduce operating expenses following delayed catalysts this year. The stock had seen a recent boost due to some over excitement about the rebound in sales at competitor Organigram, but investors should be cautioned that the revenue beat was due to low quality sales.HEXO is likely headed to new lows now as too many questions exist on whether all of these capital raises are enough to fund ongoing operating losses.HEXO Corp.HEXO Corp.", "Even as the bad news piled up for CannTrust, the rest of the cannabis industry also imploded.

Aditya Raghunath | January 25, 2020 | More on:  HEXO HEXO We know that cannabis companies have lost considerable value in the last 15 months. Shares of Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) are currently trading at $1.97 and have lost over 80% since April 2019.While a few pot stocks have made a comeback in 2020, Hexo has fallen 8.5% year to date. So, why has Hexo been one of the worst-performing pot stocks? Well, similar to peer marijuana companies, Hexo has been impacted by lower-than-expected demand for recreational cannabis products.Hexo stock lost 23% in market value on October 10 last year after the company announced preliminary fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 results (year ended in July). Hexo\u2019s sales forecast between $14.5 million and $16.5 million for Q4 was significantly lower than consensus estimates of $25.28 million.In order to take on competition from the illegal market, Hexo launched a low-cost product from its Original Stash brand. It remains to be seen if this move will boost top-line growth significantly for the firm.Hexo continues to increase distribution and market penetration across Canada. It has supply agreements with government-run and private retailers in all Canadian provinces and can access 98% of the country\u2019s populace.Hexo continues to raise capital to support growth. On January 2, 2020, Hexo closed a registered direct offering with institutional investors. Hexo offered 1.49 million shares at an offer price of US$1.67 per share for proceeds of $25 million. It then raised US$20 million on January 22, as it sold 1.19 million shares at an offer price of US$1.67 per share.Due to its steep decline, Hexo stock is trading at an attractive valuation. It is valued at $506 million, or 6.2 times 2020 sales. It has price-to-book ratio of 0.69.Hexo stock will be volatile, and the upcoming results of cannabis giants, including Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth, will be critical for the pot sector as a whole.

The claim, which is in excess of $9.8 million, is related to concentrate product that was delivered and never paid for, as well as for unpaid deposits due at the start of each month.With Hexo acquiring Newstrike last year, the burden of the massive contract was now on the Quebec-based cultivator. However, it appears the firm no longer had a means to pay what was due, despite conducting multiple raises through December and January which total out at more than C$159.0 million.The Newstrike acquisition has been troubling for that of Hexo Corp, and is perhaps the firms largest blunder of all. First, was the guidance miss for the fourth quarter of 2019, with the firm missing by upwards of 40% of the initial projection, followed by the rescinding of 2020 guidance of $400 million in revenues. Then, was the layoffs and idling of Newstrike facilities due to a lack of market demand for cannabis. Next, was the mid November revelation amid a $70 million raise that the company had been growing illegal product in a former Newstrike Niagara facility until the end of July.The Newstrike acquisition has been troubling for that of Hexo Corp, and is perhaps the firms largest blunder of all.

Next, was the mid November revelation amid a $70 million raise that the company had been growing illegal product in a former Newstrike Niagara facility until the end of July.Now, the Newstrike acquisition has resulted in Hexo potentially defaulting on one of its significant loans. As per a loan agreement filed by Hexo Corp on February 25, 2019 in relation to the firms loan with CIBC and Bank of Montreal for $65 million, Hexo Corp is considered to be in default with the loan if it receives a judgement against the firm in excess of $2.5 million. It\u2019s also considered an event of default if any asset valued in excess of $2.5 million is seized on the behalf of a credit party, or any related lien is enforced on the firm.Now, the Newstrike acquisition has resulted in Hexo potentially defaulting on one of its significant loans.

Further, it creates even further risk for the firm in that it will likely be shut out from making further loans from financial institutions due to its potential history of defaulting on loans. All of which could have been avoided had the transaction with Newstrike not occurred.As it stands, Hexo has yet to respond to the statement of claim filed by Medipharm Labs to the best of our knowledge.

As reported by BNN Bloomberg, the suit is against HEXO in connection with a supply agreement signed in February 2018 between MediPharm and Newstrike Brands, which was purchased by HEXO in March 2019.\u201cThe contract is a supply agreement for which we had serious concerns and, in an effort to drive value for our shareholders, we attempted to work in good faith towards a resolution that was suitable for both parties. Unfortunately, these efforts were unsuccessful,\u201d said Isabelle Robillard, HEXO\u2019s vice president of communications, in an email to BNN Bloomberg.According to MediPharm, HEXO is in breach of contract because it hasn\u2019t made payments under the agreement since October 2019 even as MediPharm says it delivered cannabis resin to HEXO for October. Under the terms of the agreement, there would be a firm price for the product which would \u201cnot subject to increase for any reason, including changes in market conditions, increase in raw materials, components, labour, or overhead costs or because of labour disruptions, changes in program timing or length, or fluctuation in production volumes.\u201dIn his note on Monday, Kideckel says that the non-payment issue is not an indication that HEXO is having money troubles.\u201cBased on our conversations with HEXO management, and as stated publicly by HEXO, the non-payment is related to HEXO disputing the terms of the agreement. As such, according to HEXO management, it has no relation to the Company\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Kideckel.\u201cBased on our estimates, on January 8, 2020 HEXO had an estimated capital position of $158 million, including potential proceeds from options and warrants that are exercisable and in-the-money (ITM), and the pro-rated cash generated and burned up to that date,\u201d he said.\u201cOur estimates also include $30 million related to an undrawn credit facility.

HEXO ARTICLE", " The Motley Fool Canada \u00bb Cannabis Stocks  \u00bb If You\u2019d Invested $100,000 in Hexo (TSX:HEXO) Stock in April 2019, You\u2019d Be Poorer Now                 Jason Hoang | February 3, 2020 | More on:  HEXO HEXO Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) is one of those companies that had to bear the strongest brunt of the cannabis bubble burst. Since its IPO in March 2017, Hexo stock rallied as investors were bullish on cannabis stocks. This bullish streak lasted until April 2019.From then on, Hexo stock has been continuously plummeting. The stock price, which was well on its course to enter double digits, has touched the bottom of the barrel. As of last week, the stock was trading at around $1.80.All those investors who were high on cannabis market growth and invested a significant sum of money are in trouble now. If you invested in Hexo in April 2019, then an investment of $100,000 in its shares has crashed to $20,042 since April. In other words, Hexo stock investors had to take the hit of a negative return of a whopping 81.58%.Hexo is a classic example of a company that overpromised and then underdelivered. That is the case of every other cannabis company in Canada. The sales of illegal marijuana have not dropped, as forecasted by experts. This thriving black market of cannabis is one reason why Hexo couldn\u2019t ramp up its profits.However, rising operational costs acted as a double whammy. Last year, the company hastily increased its workforce from 220 to 1,260 in anticipation of improved sales. The bulk hiring, along with other overheads, racked its operating expenses from $24.4 million to $111.5 million. This significantly affected the EBITDA margin of HEXO, which eventually spilled over its stock price as well.Last month, HEXO announced a discounted equity offering to raise US$25 million. The company has given a vague explanation of raising that money. As per its official statement, the funds would be used to promote \u201cinnovation strategies.\u201d I am not sure what these innovation strategies entail.This discounted equity offering has 15 million new shares that were priced 14% below the closing rate of December 24, 2019. Such a significant discount to the market price that is already an all-time low indicates that it won\u2019t be smooth sailing for Hexo this year.Marijuana stocks have had a rough time the past year. Some of the companies might recover. Although Hexo could possibly recover this year, the headwinds detailed above will make it a tough uphill battle to consistent profits.Cannabis stocks might get back on their feet. But for now, the abysmal performance of the cannabis market has shaken the investors. People with Hexo stock in their portfolios have lost 81.58% of its value since April, and the bad news is, there\u2019s no recovery is in sight.Fool contributor Jason Hoang has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends HEXO. and HEXO.", "Last Tuesday, Jan. 28, prior to the opening bell, institutional equity research firm MKM Partners announced a downgrade and significant price target cut to Quebec-based grower HEXO (NYSE:HEXO). Having previously rated HEXO as an outperform with a price target of 5 Canadian dollars ($3.79 U.S.), MKM Partners and its covering analyst Bill Kirk cut the company's rating to neutral and slashed its price target by 70% to CA$1.50. Despite the neutral rating, the new price target implies downside of 14% in HEXO's stock from where it closed the day prior to MKM Partners updating its rating.Why the downgrade? In the research note released, Kirk provided a laundry list of problems for the company, but suggested a recently filed lawsuit by extraction-service provider MediPharm Labs (OTC:MEDI.F) against HEXO for nonpayment of CA$9.8 million in cannabis resins was \"the straw that has broken our back.\" For those unaware, extraction providers like MediPharm process hemp and cannabis biomass for growers and provide the distillates, resins, concentrates, and/or targeted cannabinoids they use to create higher-margin derivatives. These high-margin products began hitting Canadian dispensaries shelves in mid-December.But as the note provided points out, HEXO has had all sorts of issues since October, including the departure of its chief financial officer, the complete retraction of the company's previous guidance, production cutbacks, and layoffs.Although HEXO has vowed to vigorously defend itself against MediPharm's claim of nonpayment, Kirk also notes that HEXO has a poor track record when it comes to making statements that come true. \"With a weak track record on accurately making positive predictions, it is difficult to handicap this latest issue,\" said Kirk in the note.While the MediPharm lawsuit might be the straw that broke MKM Partners' conviction in HEXO, the writing has been on the wall for months that HEXO was in some pretty deep trouble. This became especially evident after the company announced the idling of its Niagara facility in October, which was acquired when it purchased Newstrike Brands in May 2019, and laid off 200 workers from a variety of departments.Maybe the most immediate concern for HEXO is its funding. Through a combination of at-the-market offerings and a CA$70 million convertible debenture offering in December 2019 that'll come due in December 2022, HEXO looks to have raised about CA$100 million since October. But even so, its cannabis operations continue to lose money, and the company is expected to contend with a host of lawsuits, of which MediPharm has simply become the latest. With HEXO clearly reeling, it's unlikely to find any financial institutions willing to extend it an olive branch.\u00a0Another concern is that the company could lose its listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In spite of HEXO's still-reasonable $363 million market cap, its share price is dangerously close to the $1 minimum price needed to maintain continued listing on the NYSE. Historically, when a public company's stock is booted from a major exchange to the over-the-counter exchange, it does not bode well for its share price.HEXO's management team has also incited concern with commentary that it would need to gobble up 20% of Canadian market share to become profitable. Said CEO Sebastien St-Louis during the company's fiscal fourth-quarter conference call, \"[F]irst of all, the nonnegotiable is we have to be profitable in Canada and we have to be a top 2 brand in Canada. That means 20% market share nationally, and I believe that we have the assets, the people, [and] the cost structure to do that.\" HEXO is in no position to be a market share leader in Canada, with the exception of its home province of Quebec.At this point, MKM Partners' downgrade and price target cut of HEXO certainly seems fair given the numerous problems the company is contending with. But this isn't to say things can't improve for the company in 2020. The key is going to be taking baby steps in the right direction and not getting overly aggressive, which is what got most Canadian pot stocks into the current messes they're in.First, we're seeing a concerted effort by HEXO to reduce its expenditures. Even if the company winds up sacrificing its rapid growth rate in order to rein in costs, I view this as a long-term positive for the company.

Armed with massive grow facilities, these firms are either selling it directly to the market or attempting to brand their production to create customer loyalty. From the beginning, Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) forged a different path.Instead of competing directly with every other pot company, Hexo opted to launch the industry\u2019s first pot platform. That is, Hexo would provide the base infrastructure for external partners to build on top of.Ultimately, Molson chose Hexo. Hexo already has the grow facilities, research and development capabilities, and packaging and distribution centres necessary to scale up a new product quickly and cheaply. No other pot company has the infrastructure that allows any global brand to spin-up pot products this efficiently.This month, Molson and Hexo expect to release their first cannabis-infused beverages in Canada, beating nearly every competitor to market. With the Molson brand behind it, these products should gain market share quickly.The true magic of Hexo is that it can replicate this partnership dozens of times. Other pot stocks can only accommodate a single partner. Stocks like Canopy can\u2019t bring on any new partners, at least at this scale.If you want as much upside as possible, choose the only cannabis stock that can take advantage of every opportunity and partner available: Hexo.The Motley Fool recommends Constellation Brands, HEXO., and HEXO. Fool contributor Ryan Vanzo has no position in any stocks mentioned.", "With all of this being said, there's one more brand-name cannabis stock CEO who needs to go: HEXO's (NYSE:HEXO) Sebastien St-Louis.My opinion of St-Louis's performance as CEO isn't nearly as harsh as that of Booth or Bierman. HEXO wasn't exactly spending at a frivolous pace, although it likely overpaid for its Newstrike Brands acquisition in 2019. HEXO also made a number of impressive deals, including a joint venture with Molson Coors Brewing (known as Truss) to develop cannabis-infused beverages.But as MKM Partners' analyst Bill Kirk recently noted when downgrading HEXO and slashing his firm's price target on the company by 70%, HEXO's management is notorious for making positive statements that never come to fruition. Said Kirk in the note released to clients, \"Of 104 positive predictions made by HEXO over the last two years, just 3 of 48 resolved were correct.\" It's this inability to follow through and build trust with investors that has me believing St-Louis needs to go.Additionally, there are other problems. Financing, for one, is a pretty sizable short- and long-term concern for HEXO. Through a combination of stock issuances and convertible note offerings, the company raised about 100 million Canadian dollars (about $75.2 million U.S.) since October. But this may not prove to be enough, with HEXO continuing to lose money, traditional forms of financing essentially closed off, and St-Louis proclaiming in the company's most recent conference call that 20% market share would be needed throughout Canada to be profitable. Here's a news flash: No cannabis grower is anywhere near 20% market share throughout Canada, let alone HEXO.As noted, HEXO is also nowhere near profitability, despite getting very aggressive on the cost-cutting front.

This seemingly zen-like approach to business development has quite possibly set the company up for long-term success. The same certainly can't be said for more aggressive players like Aurora or HEXO.

Understandably, companies can and often do appeal delisting notices that are based on their share price. But if HEXO's share price were to fall much more, it'd be squarely in the crosshairs of the NYSE.HEXO's fall from grace had nothing to do with fraud, as was the case with CannTrust, and everything to do with Canada's aforementioned supply problems.

Between shortages and supply bottlenecks, HEXO has struggled to get product in front of its customers.Unfortunately, this is also a pot stock whose investors appear to have lost faith in management.

According to a report from boutique investment bank Ello Capital, several cannabis companies, including heavyweights such as Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB) and Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO), would need to raise additional capital sooner rather than later.Hexo is another company under the scanner. Ello Capital estimated Hexo\u2019s cash balance to be enough for 6.5 months. Hexo already has raised about $100 million since October last year by equity offerings as well as convertible debentures.Hexo ended the October quarter with a cash balance of $65.4 million. It has a total debt of $55 million, while its operating cash flow stands at -$138 million and free cash flow at -$246 million.Hexo stock too has burnt investor wealth. The stock is currently trading 83% below its 52-week high. Shares fell 20% in January 2020 after Hexo\u2019s acquisition of Newstrike came under the scanner. Newstrike was reportedly growing cannabis products illegally at its Beamsville facility in Niagara.In fiscal 2020, Hexo aims to reduce operating expenses by 25%. Like most pot companies, Hexo is also banking on Cannabis 2.0 to drive product demand higher. Its partnership with Molson Coors can also help Hexo to stay afloat, which will give the firm a chance to make a comeback.There is a chance that Aurora, Hexo, and others may be able to issue additional capital in the upcoming months.

If things turn around in the country, maybe things will also turn around for the Quebec-based company. That said, HEXO is on a bit of a time restriction: it's already close to failing to meet the minimum share price on the NYSE, and if it continues to do so, the NYSE might get in touch about the cannabis stock facing a delisting.On February 12, HEXO stock closed at $1.25. That's a mere $0.25 away from breaching the requirement. At the time of writing, as of 1:27 PM EDT, the cannabis stock is trading at $1.46. Despite being an improvement from last week, it's still a cause for concern. However, just like Sundial, if HEXO can keep its stock above $1.00, then a delisting will not be part of its future.Still, that doesn't mean other cannabis stocks won't at some point in 2020.

That was an even bigger jump than Canopy itself. HEXO's shares are still up 13% since last Thursday.You might wonder why HEXO performed so well as a result of Canopy's news. After all, the business models of the two companies are quite different. HEXO's main market is Quebec, while Canopy claims a broader-based market across multiple provinces. Canopy is a key player in Germany's medical cannabis market, while HEXO isn't.Probably the best answer to this question is that HEXO has been one of the biggest losers among marijuana stocks in recent months. It whiffed big time with its Q4 results, announced in October. Its management team lost a lot of credibility after promising that it would double its revenue from Q3 to Q4, then not coming close to achieving that prediction.But sometimes the stocks that fall the hardest are the ones that bounce back the most when there's positive news. Canopy's Q3 results brought a fresh air of optimism to investors who had become jaded about the cannabis industry. That optimism seems to have especially provided a boost to HEXO.Shares of OrganiGram\u00a0(NASDAQ:OGI)\u00a0are up more than 10% since the stock's close prior to Canopy Growth's Q3 update. Unlike HEXO, OrganiGram does have a clear connection with Canopy.

The new target price represents a fall of 29.1% from the company\u2019s closing price of 1.41 Canadian dollars on February 21. Last month, Jefferies lowered its target price from 3.80 Canadian dollars to 1.90 Canadian dollars.He stated that HEXO invested heavily in Cannabis 2.0 products. The company has 38 patents. HEXO plans to launch a variety of cannabis-infused beverages in association with Molson Coors in the first half of 2020. However, Bennett is skeptical about whether Cannabis 2.0 products will drive HEXO\u2019s revenue significantly. He thinks that the company could benefit from selling its emulsion technology or other platform technologies to consumer companies. Bennett thinks that HEXO could also benefit from partnering with consumer companies to develop cannabis-derived products.Overall, analysts favor a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for HEXO. Among the 15 analysts, seven recommend a \u201csell,\u201d two recommend a \u201cbuy,\u201d and six recommend a \u201chold.\u201d Overall, analysts have a target price of 2.35 Canadian dollars, which implies a return potential of 27.0%. Last month, MKM Partners downgraded HEXO to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d due to the concerns about the lawsuit filed by MediPharm against HEXO.In the above graph, you can see that analysts\u2019 consensus target price has seen downward momentum since September 2019. The target price has fallen by 77.6% since September. The company\u2019s weak first-quarter performance in December, concerns about dilution with new stock offerings, and MediPharm\u2019s lawsuit might have prompted analysts\u2019 to lower their target price.Let\u2019s look at analysts\u2019 recommendations for HEXO\u2019s peers:For fiscal 2020, analysts expect HEXO to report revenue of 80.5 million Canadian dollars. The estimate represents a rise of 69.3% from 47.5 million in fiscal 2019. They also expect the company to report a negative EBITDA of 57.2 million in fiscal 2020. The estimate is an improvement from a negative EBITDA of 64.1 million Canadian dollars in fiscal 2019. Notably, analysts expect the company\u2019s EBITDA to turn positive in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.On February 21, after the downgrade from Jefferies, HEXO stock fell to a low of 1.40 Canadian dollars before closing at 1.41 Canadian dollars. The stock fell 2.1% from the previous day\u2019s closing price. So far in 2020, HEXO has lost 11.3% of its stock value as of February 21. The company\u2019s stock price fell due to MediPharm\u2019s lawsuit, the new equity offering, and weakness in the cannabis sector.

The Quebec-based pot play was all the rage after Canada relaxed its ban on the recreational use of marijuana in late 2018, but just as we're going to see with space tourism, it was just a matter of too many investors chasing too few stocks. Singling out HEXO was the right call. The stock has plummeted nearly 80% in the 11 months since my original column came out.\u00a0The euphoria has died down for HEXO, but that doesn't mean the stock can't keep heading lower. It took advantage of the pop the shares experienced in early 2019 to crank out a couple of secondary offerings, and it was still printing new shares earlier this year even with the much lower stock price. It posted a sequential decline in revenue in its latest quarter, and this month it replaced its auditor and lost a board member. The only two HEXO analyst moves this month have been downgrades by MKM Partners and Jeffries.

The case for buying on weakness is therefore about as good as it\u2019s going to get, indicating a fairly strong buy for those bullish on a second \u201cgreen gold rush.\u201d While a high target price of $10 is optimistic, it shows how high this stock could potentially climb.With cannabis edibles, drinks and the whole gamut of other cannabis product types representing a valid long-term growth sector, there is clearly an intriguing thesis for capital gains in the Canadian weed space.

However, it\u2019s a long way off its low value price, so if it\u2019s a bargain pot stock you\u2019re after, you should stick with HEXO.More insiders have been buying HEXO shares than selling in 2020, while Aurora\u2019s inner circle have been ditching theirs, showing the lay of the land in terms of confidence.With plummeting revenue across business segments, Aurora is a long-term sell \u2013 the polar opposite of popular cannabis pick HEXO, which is more than worthy of a long position in a TSX stock portfolio\u2019s cannabis segment at its current valuation.Getting a head start in terms of Canadian growth is still a primary objective for domestic cannabis producers, and HEXO could deliver.

HEXO stock is definitely in the latter category, slumping by 85% from its 52-week high.Two analysts recently downgraded HEXO stock and revised their price outlook for HEXO Corp (TSX:HEXO) (NYSE:HEXO).Two analysts recently downgraded HEXO stock and revised their price outlook for HEXO Corp (TSX:HEXO) (NYSE:HEXO).One of the more important concerns is the potential size of the Canadian market. Jeffries analyst Owen Bennett stated that there is a bit too much optimism about the Canadian market, adding that the boost from cannabis 2.0 is going to be virtually \"non-existent\" in the near-term. In addition to that, the slow roll-out of retail outlets in places like Quebec and Ontario remains a concern for further growth.HEXO stock is now down by over 4% to $1.19.For a while, it seemed like HEXO could have emerged as one of the leaders in the cannabis-infused beverages niche, but now it seems that might be far more difficult than previously anticipated.The company teamed up with Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) to produce cannabis beverages, and one of its initial products is a CBD-infused spring water named Flow Glow. However, companies like Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED) (NYSE:CGC) have found it difficult to identify the sort of beverages that might work in the United States, a problem that HEXO may also be faced with. Because of this, some of the optimism surrounding the space appears to have dissipated somewhat.In addition to that, the company\u2019s balance sheet suggests that it is not exactly flush with funds at this time. At the end of October 2019, the company had $65.4 million in cash balance and a free cash flow of a highly disappointing negative $246 million. As a matter of fact, Ello Capital expects HEXO to run out of cash in six to seven months.Moreover, HEXO stock made a new 52-week low of $1.11 earlier in today's session.>> Read More HEXO NewsHEXO stock is in the red today after Stifel analyst W.

Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 49% in the last 90 days.  View our latest analysis for HEXO  Because HEXO made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That\u2019s because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.  In the last twelve months, HEXO increased its revenue by 494%. That\u2019s well above most other pre-profit companies. So the hefty 80% share price crash makes us think the company has somehow offended market participants. There\u2019s clearly something unusual going on here such as an acquisition that hasn\u2019t delivered expected profits. We\u2019d recommend taking a very close look at the stock (and any available forecasts), before considering a purchase, because the share price is not correlated with the revenue growth, that\u2019s for sure. Of course, investors do over-react when they are stressed out, so the sell-off could be unjustifiably severe.  It\u2019s probably worth noting we\u2019ve seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think HEXO will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).  HEXO shareholders are down 80% for the year, even worse than the market loss of 11%. That\u2019s disappointing, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the market-wide selling wouldn\u2019t have helped. With the stock down 49% over the last three months, the market doesn\u2019t seem to believe that the company has solved all its problems. Basically, most investors should be wary of buying into a poor-performing stock, unless the business itself has clearly improved. It\u2019s always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand HEXO better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we\u2019ve spotted   4 warning signs for HEXO   (of which 1 doesn\u2019t sit too well with us!) you should know about.

This would normally not be a major issue, but MediPharm is still a nascent company, and HEXO is contending with a plethora of issues that have led it to idle a good chunk of its cultivation space and lay off 200 employees.

The Canadian cannabis company hasn\u2019t been a favorite in the sector for a while now due to struggling revenues in part due to its focus on Quebec, but the company made the wise decision to move into the value brand before the market. Due to weak analyst expectations, HEXO might be one cannabis company to beat estimates this quarter.Back in 2019, HEXO made the bold move to establish a value brand selling bulk dried cannabis at low prices to match the illegal market. The company launched Original Stash in October and rolled out the value brand to Ontario via the Ontario Cannabis Store on Black Friday. The product retails for 28 grams (1 oz) at C$140 (C$5 per gram), including taxes.HEXO originally provided positive indication of the value brand having market success, but the key indicator the company was onto the right market direction was the news from Aurora Cannabis (ACB). As the Canadian cannabis leader announced a major restructuring plan, it signaled plans to launch a value brand called The Daily Special.Noteworthy, HEXO took the drastic decision early to go way below the value price cutoff. Health Canada released the average cannabis price of the illegal market was C$5.73 per gram in December pitting HEXO below the cost of the illegal market.Analysts are forecasting HEXO to reach FQ2 revenues of $12.6 million or C$16.9 million after the company only reported FQ1 revenues of C$14.5 million. The opportunity here is for HEXO to actually surprise on the upside considering the market shift so drastically to the value sector during the last quarter and the company's quarterly results will include two months of Cannabis 2.0 products.Aurora Cannabis has acted so quickly to launch a value brand for this reason. Investors will key into the margins from HEXO selling product at these lower price points. The general Canadian sector has struggled with generating solid margins, even when revenues are up because so much product is being dumped below expected prices.According to TipRanks, an investing platform that tracks and measures the performance of financial experts, the consensus on Wall Street is that HEXO stock is a \u201chold\u201d for investors. But TipRanks might as well have said \u201cbuy\u201d \u2014 because analysts, on average, think the stock, currently at $1.20, could zoom ahead to $1.72 within a year, delivering 43% profits to new investors. (See Inovio stock analysis on TipRanks)The key investor takeaway is that HEXO is well positioned to benefit from a Canadian cannabis market where the leaders were too focused on premium products. The launch of a value brand last year sets the company up for beating analyst consensus estimates and finally improving the financial prospects of the beaten down stock.HEXO Corp.HEXO Corp.", "  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)"], "sample size": 20, "page count": 10}, "03/06/2020": {"synonyms": "hexo", "pos": 0.05566666666666667, "neg": 0.10066666666666668, "neu": 0.8436666666666666, "com": -0.3002333333333333, "raw text": ["With a number of cannabis companies announcing layoffs, including Tilray (NYSE:TLRY) with a 10% reduction of its workforce, Hexo Corp.

(TSX:HEXO) moving forward.Similar to most cannabis producers, Hexo has been absolutely ravished by the stock market over the past year. Hexo was one of the first producers to announce layoffs, and has run into a litany of production problems which have stunted any attempts the market tried to make to push the company\u2019s share price higher.The problems continue to pile on every week, it seems. Most investors have exited the fray, viewing Hexo as too risky.Hexo has secured a serious chunk of provincial contracts in Quebec to sell cannabis to the provincial buyer. For a relatively small producer, this has been huge for investor confidence initially.With the rollout of physical locations across Canada disappointing the cannabis sector, and specifically investors, questions remain as to just how much of the contracted amount Hexo will be able to sell through legal marijuana channels in Quebec.That said, investors can bank on the Quebec government stepping in and buying weed from Hexo to prop the company up, even if the province has to throw away the product and taxpayers are forced to eat the cost.The Quebec government will want to have a favourite child to point to in the cannabis sector. Right now, that\u2019s Hexo.The big question for many, however, is whether Hexo will have the ability to ramp up and produce larger amounts in such a scenario.Demand hasn\u2019t been what was expected by investors. Obviously, most cannabis consumption estimates pre-legalization were ridiculous. Thus, Hexo has been forced to lay off workers en masse and close down underperforming facilities.While I\u2019m in the camp that believes these moves were prudent financial decisions that needed to be made for Hexo to survive, it will be interesting to see what would happen in the scenario described above.That said, I have this funny feeling that Hexo might find a way to hang on \u2014 perhaps with a little help \u2014 for a lot longer than some of its competitors.The Motley Fool recommends HEXO.", "It's the same story with Quebec-based HEXO (NYSE:HEXO), which announced plans in October to idle its 240,000-square-foot Niagara grow farm, as well as 200,000 square feet of cultivation space at its flagship Gatineau facility. I'd estimate this reduces HEXO's peak yearly production capacity by close to one-third. HEXO also wound up laying off 200 workers.

The harsh truth is that there are far too many mouths to feed in the Candian cannabis market, and HEXO doesn't have the cash runway to hang with its bigger competitors.\u00a0Second, HEXO is also bumping up against the minimum bid requirement for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). With its shares now at a $1.09, HEXO may soon have to decide whether to delist from the NYSE or execute a reverse split to meet the minimum bid requirement of $1 per share. In short, there's no compelling reason to think this struggling cannabis stock can turn things around anytime soon.\u00a0"], "sample size": 29, "page count": 10}, "03/10/2020": {"synonyms": "hexo", "pos": 0.12014285714285715, "neg": 0.047, "neu": 0.8330000000000001, "com": 0.5913857142857142, "raw text": ["  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)When it comes to the cannabis beverage opportunity, Canopy Growth Corporation (WEED.TO) (CGC) and HEXO Corporation (HEXO.TO) (HEXO) are two of the first companies to come to mind.

Unlike Canopy Growth\u2019s agreement with Constellation Brands, HEXO\u2019s agreement with Molson Coors did not include an investment and this represented a key differentiator between the companies.Another way that HEXO has been similar to Canopy Growth is related to its inability to bring a cannabis beverage product to market. The Canadian cannabis producer has been having a tough time and recently had to lay off 10% of its staff. HEXO has been shutting down facilities and is working to become profitable.We do not expect the cannabis beverage market to benefit HEXO in the near future and believe that it missed out on a substantial opportunity. Since inception, there has seemed to be a major disconnect between HEXO\u2019s management team and the market. This worried us from the beginning, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic with the opportunity.Earlier this month, we highlighted HYTN Brands as a leading play on the Canadian cannabis beverage market. Unlike Canopy Growth and HEXO, HYTN has been able to execute on previously announced initiatives and is actually selling cannabis beverages in Canada.HYTN has visible growth prospects and has been highly focused on penetrating the Canadian cannabis market.

HEXO need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 21, 2020 $1.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for HEXO shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, HEXO is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Products industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter widened from a loss of 6 cents per share to a loss of 7 cents.Given the way analysts feel about HEXO right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The string of bad news started in October 2019 when CFO Michael Monahan resigned. Since then, the company\u2019s earnings results haven\u2019t impressed investors. The company\u2019s bleak outlook for 2020 also pulled the stock down. Hexo stock had been hovering around $1. Cannabis stocks have fallen hard due to the recent market turmoil amid the coronavirus scare and declining oil prices. Hexo went below $1, which put it at risk of delisting from the exchange along with a few other cannabis stocks.Marijuana stocks soared in 2018 after Canada legalized recreational cannabis. However, 2019 was disastrous for cannabis companies and their stocks. Most of the companies have lost a considerable amount of their stock value. Hexo stock lost 70% in 2019. Hexo was one of the first cannabis stocks to be listed on a major stock exchange. Now, the stock might get delisted from the exchange.Hexo disappointed investors with its first-quarter earnings. The company missed analysts\u2019 revenue estimates of 15.6 million Canadian dollars and reported 14.5 million Canadian dollars. The EBITDA loss was higher at 24.6 million Canadian dollars compared to analysts\u2019 estimate of a 21.4 million Canadian dollar loss.Usually, the exchange sends a warning letter to the company to provide a plan of action on how to get its shares back on track. Among the cannabis companies, only CannTrust got a warning letter. However, the company\u2019s issues were different. For Hexo, Canada\u2019s supply issue and a rise in black market sales pulled down the company\u2019s revenue and profitability. However, there\u2019s still hope. The company could still pull back if things improve in Canada. Cannabis 2.0 products have just been released into the market. The cannabis companies will still release a few more products. Canada is on track to open more legal shops to fight illegal cannabis sales. So, there\u2019s hope for Hexo to improve its revenue and profitability.The company could report its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 this month. Analysts expect Hexo\u2019s revenue to rise by 25% YoY (year-over-year) to 16.8 million Canadian dollars. Sequentially, the expectations show a slight increase in revenue from 14.5 million Canadian dollars in the first quarter. Sequentially, the EBITDA loss could fall to 15 million Canadian dollars from 24.6 million in the first quarter. The company also stated in its first-quarter earnings call that it\u2019s working diligently to become adjusted EBITDA positive in 2020.Currently, analysts look bearish on Hexo. Among the 17 analysts that cover the stock, six recommend a \u201chold,\u201d five recommend a \u201csell,\u201d three recommend a \u201cbuy,\u201d and three recommend a \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The average target price on the stock is 2.35 Canadian dollars. The target price shows an upside potential of 128% from Thursday\u2019s closing price of 1.03 Canadian dollars.Recently, MarketWatch reported that a\u00a0Stifel analyst gave a \u201csell\u201d rating for Hexo with a 12-month target price of 1.15 Canadian dollars.

But Newstrike\u2019s original news announcement about their deal with LABS frames it as a commitment to supply the extractor with cannabis, while retaining the first right to buy the extracted product back from LABS.That likely sounded like a fine idea to Newstrike in September of 2018, when this whole industry was still brand new. Potentially, Hexo, who has since bought Newstrike\u2019s mess, could have realized that taking delivery of extracts from Medipharm would invalidate the prior bulk sale of the feedstock come audit time, and stick Hexo with inventory that\u2019s not moving; which is not a good place to be at year-end.", "After slashing its guidance in October for fiscal 2020, HEXO (NYSE:HEXO) said it would try to undercut the black market by offering lower-priced products. The company announced its new brand, \"Original Stash,\" would come in lower than not just the average legal price of cannabis in Canada, but below black-market prices as well. It's an aggressive strategy to try and win market share but it may not be viable given the need to maximize margins rather than to chip away at them. In the company's most recent quarterly results, which HEXO released in December, it reported a negative gross margin of CA$21 million after fair value adjustments. That was mainly due to inventory impairments.

HEXO shares plummeted by 80% in the final months of 2019 after enjoying rates of more than 140% earlier in the year. Despite the decline, many investors are eagerly looking at the opportunity to get in and buy HEXO stock while prices are low.If you want to take advantage of lower share prices and buy HEXO stock, follow the steps below.\u00a0To buy HEXO stock, you need to find an options brokerage that fits your investment style. Options are derivative financial instruments, meaning that their value is based on something else. Usually, options are based on the value of underlying securities like stocks. You can buy or sell HEXO stock through an options contract, which will include a stated price, or strike price (more on this in the next section), and a specific expiration date.Options are typically bought or sold through brokers, and unlike futures, you are never required to buy or sell an asset if you do not wish to. You can purchase HEXO shares through online brokerage accounts that support trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Interactive Traders.HEXO currently controls around 30% of Quebec\u2019s marijuana market and has a multi-year supply agreement in place. HEXO is therefore considered more stable than other local competitors and is predicted to capture around 10% of Canada\u2019s overall cannabis market within the next few years. Additionally, HEXO\u2019s recent joint-venture deal with Molson Coors Brewing has placed HEXO in a position of potential to expand internationally outside of Canada.\u00a0\u00a0HEXO stock is currently trading at less than half of its April high price. With 1 share of HEXO stock selling for around $0.80 USD, many investors are eager to capitalize on low prices and hedge their bets that HEXO will regain momentum in coming years. If you\u2019re willing to wait out the near-term volatility, now\u2019s the time to grab HEXO stock while it\u2019s cheap.HEXO\u2019s ability to secure deals both inside and outside of the industry sets it apart from other competitors in the cannabis sector. Not only did HEXO recently sign a multi-year extraction service agreement with Valens GoWorks, but also its joint-venture deal with Molson Coors Brewing has positioned HEXO to be a leading figure in cannabis-infused beverage sales.\u00a0HEXO stock may have declined in recent months but it is still expensive compared to other sectors in the market. HEXO shares are trading at about 44 times the company\u2019s sales, which is extremely high compared to other industries like healthcare whose average is around 2 times.In July 2019, co-founder Adam Miron announced his departure from his role as chief branding officer. Given that HEXO stock was in the middle of a steady decline at the time, the exit of a key member in upper-management has given investors second thoughts about the stability and direction of the company.Though the marijuana market has stirred up a lot of excitement among businesses and investors alike, it is still a young industry. Consequently, the industry is navigating regulatory concerns and making decisions based on future policy predictions. Regulations have proven challenging for HEXO, who announced it had to scale back planned operations due to backlogged retail and cultivation license approvals.\u00a0Despite a rough ending to 2019, investors haven\u2019t written off HEXO Corp. Its ability to secure deals has placed it in a position of potential growth moving forward. If you\u2019re willing to wait out short-term volatility as HEXO Corp and the marijuana industry sorting through some growing pains, you may see high returns again in the future.\u00a0Despite a rough ending to 2019, investors haven\u2019t written off HEXO Corp.

The company cited a slower-than-expected rollout across Canada of retail outlets and delays in government approval for cannabis derivative products as contributing factors.\u201cThese factors are indicators of impairment in relation to the Company\u2019s inventory, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. The Company is in the process of completing its impairment assessment and has not reach its final conclusions. However, it is expected that the impairment loss will be in the range of $265 million to $280 million,\u201d said the HEXO press release.The release also said HEXO would be selling its Niagara facilities, acquired in the deal last year for Newstrike Brands, and that it had established a trade blackout for directors, officers and other insiders which will continue up until the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2020 results are filed.The company added that its future is in jeopardy due to the lack of available capital in the cannabis market and HEXO\u2019s accumulated losses to date.In his update to clients, Kideckel said the current COVID-19 pandemic adds more strain to HEXO and other cannabis companies, as the potential closure of currently operating cannabis stores, \u201ccould depress sales over the near-term and worsen the demand and supply imbalance in the Canadian cannabis market, ultimately leading to higher cash burn rates,\u201d Kideckel said.\u201cWe believe that HEXO is facing a storm of negative conditions which add significant uncertainty to its outlook and may thwart the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy in the near-to-medium term,\u201d Kideckel wrote.\u201cWe note that HEXO\u2019s strategy for cannabis derivative products is based on a national portfolio launch, which we believe would lead to improvement in margins and revenue growth. However, given current market conditions, this revenue and margin improvement may not happen over the near-term, which adds risk and uncertainty to the Company\u2019s outlook,\u201d he said.With the HEXO press release came some financial data on the company\u2019s Q2 2020, including net revenue which was listed as $17.0 million, a 17-per-cent increase on the previous quarter.The analyst said while conditions look strained for HEXO and the cannabis sector over the short and medium term, his long-term outlook remains unchanged.Filed Under: All posts, Cannabis Tagged With: hexo", "  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)"], "sample size": 20, "page count": 10}, "03/19/2020": {"synonyms": "hexo", "pos": 0.0575, "neg": 0.02375, "neu": 0.9185000000000001, "com": 0.21785, "raw text": ["Hexo (TSE:HEXO) closed with a loss of 19% on March 18.

Many analysts have downgraded the stock and reduced its target price.Hexo announced that it will delay its second-quarter results. The company stated that it has incurred an impairment loss.

Hexo\u2019s downfall started last year when it withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance.

Altacorp downgraded the stock to \u201cunderperform\u201d from \u201csector perform.\u201d The firm also lowered the target price for the stock to $1.2 from $3.15. Kideckel said that \u201cthe current COVID-19 pandemic adds more strain to HEXO and other cannabis companies, as the potential closure of currently operating cannabis stores, \u201ccould depress sales over the near-term and worsen the demand and supply imbalance in the Canadian cannabis market, ultimately leading to higher cash burn rates.\u201dThere was hope that Hexo\u2019s Cannabis 2.0 products would improve its margins and revenue growth. However, looking at the current negative conditions, analysts don\u2019t think that the company\u2019s outlook is certain. Hexo\u2019s net revenue for the second quarter was 17.0 million Canadian dollars, which was above analysts\u2019 estimate of 15 million Canadian dollars. However, the analyst revised his estimate based on the current market conditions. Now, he expects Hexo\u2019s fiscal 2020 revenue to be around 63.2 million Canadian dollars. He expects an\u00a0EBITDA loss of 39.5 million Canadian dollars.Alliance Global Partners also reduced the target price to 2.5 Canadian dollars from 3.5 Canadian dollars. Currently, 15 analysts cover Hexo stock. Among the analysts, six recommend a \u201csell,\u201d three recommend a \u201cstrong sell,\u201d two recommend a \u201cbuy,\u201d and four recommend a \u201chold.\u201d The average target price on the stock is 1.81 Canadian dollars. The target price shows an upside potential of 247% from the current trading price.Currently, Hexo stock is in the middle of a storm. When a stock falls below $1 on the exchange, it has one month to revive its stock price before it receives a warning letter from the exchange. After the stock receives the letter, it has to develop a plan of action for the exchange on how it plans to revive its stock price. After the recent negative news, Hexo stock is trending downwards. The stock closed with a loss of 19.2% at $0.36 on the NYSE and a loss of 20% at 0.52 Canadian dollars on the Canadian exchange.Like other cannabis companies, Hexo is also prepared to launch its Cannabis 2.0 products in the market this year. However, the recent pandemic has put a halt on cannabis sales. The halt will impact companies\u2019 current revenues and profitability. We can only hope that the crisis ends soon. Like Hexo, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) is also at the risk of delisting. Aurora Cannabis stock fell 11.9% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC)(TSE:WEED), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), and Aphria fell 6.1%, 4.1%, and 1.3%, respectively.I think that some analysts still have a positive outlook for the marijuana industry despite the current headwinds. AltaCorp Capital\u2019s analyst also stated that his long-term outlook for the sector hasn\u2019t changed. He said, \u201cIn our view, the entry of new products into the market should lead to significant growth in sales in the industry and a rerating of companies across the sector over the long-term. However, over the near-term, we expect the Canadian cannabis industry will continue to face headwinds from a slow retail store rollout, as well as deteriorating economic conditions due to the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d", "Leading the index were\u00a0Hexo Corp\u00a0,\u00a0up\u00a055.8%,\u00a0Primo Water Corp (MISSISSAUGA)\u200b\u00a0, up\u00a025.1%, and\u00a0Interfor Corp\u200b\u00a0,\u00a0higher by\u00a024%.Leading the index were\u00a0Hexo Corp\u00a0,\u00a0up\u00a055.8%,\u00a0Primo Water Corp (MISSISSAUGA)\u200b\u00a0, up\u00a025.1%, and\u00a0Interfor Corp\u200b\u00a0,\u00a0higher by\u00a024%.", "OTTAWA, March  19, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HEXO Corp.

The stock market is in the midst of a melt down and any perceived bad news is going to crush any stock. The good news was a revenue beat for the quarter and the delayed filing for an asset impairment charge isn\u2019t necessarily impactful to the investment story.On March 17, HEXO announced a delay of the FQ2 financials due for the quarter ending January 31. The filing was due on March 16.HEXO ended the October quarter with C$330 million of property, plant and equipment with another C$235 million in intangible assets and goodwill and inventory at C$85 million. These asset levels are very high for their revenue base.In addition, the company plans to sell their Niagara facility to completely pull the facility out of future production plans. Closing the facility for good isn\u2019t surprising considering the market shift to outdoor production and HEXO producing 16k kg in the last few quarters while only selling slightly above 4K kg per quarter.The net sales number is key as HEXO has only reached a previous quarterly high of C$15.4 million back in FQ4. The amount was even slightly above analyst estimates.The initial numbers provide some encouragement that HEXO was on pace to meet goals for substantial revenue growth throughout 2020 as new stores rollout in Canada and Cannabis 2.0 products reach the market. The coronavirus could shut down the momentum in the current quarter.The consensus price target of $1.17 shows a double-digit upside, but based on all the ratings received over the past three months, the consensus rating on HEXO is a Moderate Sell, at least according to TipRanks. While 2 analysts are on the Buy side, 3 say Hold and 5 advise investors to abandon ship. (See Hexo stock analysis on TipRanks)The key investor takeaway is that HEXO got beaten to a pulp due to a delayed quarterly filing, but the company beat on key revenue figures.\u00a0 HEXO is clearly hitting a point where the company is finally achieving real momentum in the market.As Canada gets beyond the coronavirus crisis that has already caused Canopy Growth to close stores, HEXO is a stock to own.HEXO Corp.HEXO Corp.", "  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)HEXO Corp.

David Jagielski | March 25, 2020 | More on:  HEXO HEXO HEXO Corp (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) and other pot stocks have been erratic over the past several weeks. The markets as a whole have been unstable. And that\u2019s made already volatile pot stocks even more of a roller-coaster ride of late.HEXO Corp (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) and other pot stocks have been erratic over the past several weeks. The markets as a whole have been unstable. And that\u2019s made already volatile pot stocks even more of a roller-coaster ride of late.HEXO is a shadow of the company it once was. It no longer has its aggressive $400 million sales forecast for fiscal 2020 and the excitement surrounding the stock has waned. Earlier this month, the company announced more bad news: it would be delaying the release of its second-quarter results and expects to record an impairment charge as well.In early January, HEXO announced it had completed refiling and restating its year-end results for fiscal 2019. The company had to make corrections, including to its deferred tax liability that was overstated. Earlier this month, the company refiled its management discussion and analysis (MD&A) for fiscal 2019 as well as for the quarter ending October 31, 2019. News of another filing delay now in the second quarter is par for the course given the company\u2019s recent track record.This latest update also comes after HEXO announced in February that it would be changing its auditors, and that a member of its board of directors, Nathalie Bourque, was resigning in yet another high-profile departure. There is no reason given for the changes and to suggest any would be pure speculation.It\u2019s not unusual for a company to change auditors. But given the restatements, refilings, and now a \u201csignificant\u201d write-down \u2013 expected to be as much as $280 million, according to BNN Bloomberg \u2013 things are not going smoothly at HEXO, to say the least.It may seem like a lot of paperwork going on, and correcting and changing numbers, that\u2019s taking place. But it could be a cause for concern. If a company\u2019s financials are not correct then investors cannot rely on them. Knowing there may be an adjustment later on makes it harder to evaluate a company\u2019s performance. And at this point, it would be hard to take HEXO\u2019s financials at face value and assume that they will remain unchanged.In the past year, HEXO\u2019s stock has fallen around 90%. That\u2019s a mammoth decline even in the pot sector where valuations have been cratering in recent months. But the danger is that HEXO\u2019s shares can always go lower. A low share price shouldn\u2019t be the reason to invest in the company. And investors shouldn\u2019t ignore the problems relating to the company\u2019s financials. They may be signs of poor governance and controls.Someone inputting the wrong number on a balance sheet or income statement doesn\u2019t mean that HEXO can\u2019t efficiently grow pot or that there\u2019s no market for its products. But it could be symptomatic of a company that isn\u2019t running a tight ship.

Kideckel, who reviewed HEXO\u2019s new quarterly results in an update to clients on Monday.Shares of HEXO were up sharply on Tuesday after the company released its second quarter fiscal 2020 results, featuring total revenue of $17.0 million, up from $14.5 million in the previous quarter.HEXO saw a 57 per cent increase in its adult-use grams and gram equivalents sold to 6,579 kg compared to Q1, while production levels climbed to 22,305 kg compared to 16,107 in the previous quarter.The results come after HEXO announced earlier in March both a delay in the release of quarterly numbers and a downsized and more depressing outlook for the company, including new impairment charges related to the purchase last year of Newstrike Brands, with management pointing to a slower-than-expected rollout of retail across Canada as a prime factor.\u201cWe have continued our focus on improving our operations and expanding distribution across Canada.\u00a0Our strategy with Original Stash has demonstrated that we can directly compete with the black market,\u201d said St-Louis in a press release. \u201cThe industry continues to see challenges ahead, and following a strategic review of the Company\u2019s core and non-core assets we believe we have positioned HEXO to meet these challenges head on.\u201dKideckel said he\u2019s taking a conservative approach when it comes to HEXO due to two factors: the potential increase in sales contribution related to HEXO\u2019s value-priced brand Origin Stash, which may put gross margins under pressure and due to the COVID-19 crisis, which may cause a delay in the launch of derivatives, a hopefully margin-improving development.\u201cWe believe that HEXO is facing a storm of negative conditions which add significant uncertainty to its outlook and may thwart the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy in the near-to-medium term,\u201d Kideckel wrote.The analyst forecasted fiscal 2020 revenue and adjusted EBITDA for HEXO of $63.2 million and negative $290.0 million, respectively, and fiscal 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $91.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively.HEXO Corp (HEXO Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:HEXO) received a downward rerating from AltaCorp Capital\u2026HEXO Corp (HEXO Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:HEXO) received a downward rerating from AltaCorp Capital\u2026Filed Under: All posts, Cannabis Tagged With: hexo", "You know there was some bad news with a company's quarterly update when the stock tanks after the results are announced.

As HEXO slowly regains its footings from the sector collapse and company specific problems, investors can finally start looking toward the long-term potential of the Molson Coors (TAP) partnership.Somehow, some financial websites listed HEXO as missing FQ2 estimates despite the company providing an update placing revenues at C$17.0 million. The company hit this number exactly on target and importantly cut EBITDA losses in half to C$10.3 million. Gone are the days of HEXO producing massive losses after the two prior quarters combined for EBITDA losses of nearly C$50.0 million.According to calculations, HEXO burned C$51 million of cash from operations during the quarter, up from C$34 million in the prior quarter. The huge cash burn of C$80 million was despite an improvement in the capex spending with a C$16 million dip in the sequential quarte to C$29 million.Even the reduced level of capex spending still has HEXO spending nearly double on facilities as the level of net revenues of only C$17 million. The other issue is the company producing nearly 4x the amount of cannabis sold on a quarterly basis.The company plans to shutter the Niagara Facility for good, but HEXO has to reduce quarterly cannabis cultivation to levels commensurate with sales. As an example, inventory levels ended the January quarter with a balance of C$94 million, up from C$85 million in FQ1 despite the C$16 million write down. The inventory levels are at levels that will cover product sales for up to a year.While the big write downs are sometimes ignored in businesses with a focus on current operations, the Canadian cannabis industry still hasn\u2019t been able to match cultivation levels with cannabis sales levels to avoid dumping assets. The big step for the upcoming FQ3 report will be HEXO turning the improvements in operations on the income statement into an improving balance sheet with a substantial cut in cash burn as inventory turns into cash.The key investor takeaway is that HEXO got beaten down again following the reporting of the FQ2 report after the initial delay. The company is slowly making positive steps and started this quarter with C$81 million in cash, but management suggests the need to raise more capital this fiscal year. If the company can turn the inventory into cash and reduce the capital requirements, the stock is a solid buy below $1 as the Molson Coors partnership starts to produce cannabis beverages.Despite the recent sell-off, HEXO boasts \u201cvery positive\u201d sentiment from TipRanks investors \u2013 a readout of individual investor portfolios tracked by TipRanks on its Smart Portfolio platform.HEXO Corp.HEXO Corp.", "This first week of April has been the never-ending week for the cannabis industry that has been continuously gut punched on a daily basis.

However, just because a stock is cheap doesn't necessarily mean it's a buy. While now may be an opportune time to buy shares of great businesses with solid prospects, there are many stocks investors should avoid no matter how cheap they seem to be. In particular, here are two cannabis companies I think investors had better stay away from: Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) and Hexo (NYSE:HEXO).Hexo has been a hot mess in recent weeks, and not just because the company's stock is down 57% since the beginning of the year. On March 17, Hexo announced that the release of its earnings report for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2020 would be delayed. The delay was because Hexo had failed to file its \"interim financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis\" by the appropriate deadline. This wasn't the first time the company's quarterly financial report was delayed, either -- something similar happened with Hexo's fourth-quarter earnings report for fiscal 2019.With that said, though, I believe Hexo has to contend with much bigger problems than just this delay. For instance, the pot grower's actual financial results continue to be unimpressive. During the second quarter, Hexo reported a net loss of CA$298.2 million, its deepest quarterly net loss ever. And although Hexo reported a net revenue of CA$17 million -- representing a 17% sequential increase -- investors weren't pleased with the company's performance, and Hexo's shares plunged on the heels of its earnings release.Another reason to stay away from Hexo is the fact that the pot grower has\u00a0been heavily resorting to dilutive forms of financing recently. In October, the company decided to launch a round of funding (which closed in December) during which Hexo raised CA$70 million by issuing convertible debentures.\u00a0The cannabis company then started another round of financing in late December, raising CA$25 million by issuing new shares; this round of financing closed in early January. Lastly, Hexo raised another CA$20 million in January by issuing new shares once again. Hexo's latest round of funding closed Jan. 22.\u00a0Hexo is probably not done with these dilutive forms of financing. In its press release announcing its second-quarter financial results, the company said the following: \"Management estimates that the working capital as [of] January 31, 2020 and forecasted cash flows will require additional capitalization in order to meet the Company's obligations, commitments and budgeted expenditures through January 31, 2021.\" Share dilution problems will keep plaguing Hexo in the future; coupled with the company's poor financial results, this makes its stock unattractive. In short, investors had better keep their distances from Hexo, despite its shares going for less than a dollar apiece at the moment.", "April 8 (Reuters) - Hexo Corp: April 8 (Reuters) - Hexo Corp: * HEXO CORP.

However, the cannabis market collapse threw HEXO\u2019s stock into a free fall. Then comes this ongoing market crash that has hammered the stock further.For starters, the cannabis company has been continuously delaying its quarterly financial results. It announced that it will delay the release of its second-quarter 2020 results. This is mainly due to the undetermined value of impairment charges. As the book value of the net assets of HEXO exceeded its market value, an impairment test became necessary.Also, HEXO has made many financial report restatements for the 2019 fiscal year. Continuous disclosure issues, as identified by the regulators, are causing HEXO to keep amending its MD&A for 2019. One should keep in mind that continuous disclosure has caused a lot of trouble for Home Capital Group in the recent past.HEXO has also started selling its assets, which is another indication that things might be heading to the point of no return. In that context, if HEXO is not able to generate revenue from its profitable internal operations, it may likely waive its \u201cgoing concern\u201d status and file for bankruptcy.HEXO and Baytex Energy may avoid bankruptcy.

In the long run, this CA$9.8 million is peanuts -- yet not so for a relatively new company that's still building its recurring revenue stream and trying to prove itself to Wall Street.

It is smaller participants that are the most at risk.\u00a0Canada\u2019s fifth-largest cultivator HEXO (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) is under considerable financial pressure. In its fiscal second-quarter 2020 results, HEXO flagged that it lacks enough resources to remain a going concern. The cultivator was also forced to raise $40 million in equity before the end of this month under its revised debt convents.While that was a substantial amount in the current difficult operating environment, HEXO this week completed a $46 million public offering. That has allowed HEXO to comply with its debt covenants and fund working capital requirements. The offering was dilutive for existing shareholders and didn\u2019t raise enough funding to prevent HEXO from having to go to the markets for further capital.The cultivator is experiencing regulatory issues with its Niagara growing facility. HEXO reported $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges for the fiscal second quarter. The issues responsible for those charges have yet to be fully resolved. HEXO\u2019s precarious financial position will be impacted by additional impairment charges during 2020, making it vulnerable to bankruptcy.Cannabis stocks are under considerable pressure. The coronavirus pandemic has magnified the issues already afflicting the legal cannabis industry. A key hazard is that capital is drying up, as financial institutions prepare for the inevitable recession and influx of loan defaults. For these reasons, bankruptcies will continue to grow during 2020. Many cannabis stocks, particularly those like HEXO that are managing a precarious financial situation, are highly unappealing investments.Fool contributor Matt Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The stock has lost close to 70.2% year-to-date. As a result, the stock is also at risk of getting delisted. Cannabis stocks have risen due to increased demand and sales. However, the surge might not be enough to help revive the stock. Recently, Hexo announced another deal with Molson Coors to expand its CBD footprint in the US. Will it help Hexo recover in 2020?Last week, Hexo and Molson Coors Beverage announced a joint venture called \u201cTruss CBD USA\u201d in Colorado. The new venture will focus on non-alcohol hemp-derived CBD beverages.Sebastien St-Louis, Hexo\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said, \u201cI am thrilled with the opportunity to bring those learnings to Colorado, under the leadership of Molson Coors, Powered by HEXO.\u201dHexo and Molson Coors have already made a mark in the Canadian market with their joint venture called \u201cTruss Beverages.\u201d The company will launch its CBD-based beverage products later this year. There\u2019s a huge demand for Cannabis 2.0 products, especially beverages. According to Deloitte\u2019s research paper, Canada has seen out-of-stock rates for CBD-based products that are higher than any other cannabis products. The data showed that around 31% of cannabis consumers are interested in CBD-infused beverages. The demand for cannabis edibles and other products is huge even in the US.Cannabis demand and sales have risen amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Capturing the Canadian market with CBD products might not be difficult for Hexo. However, the FDA has doubts about using CBD in food and beverages. The cannabis industry is still waiting on the FDA to approve CBD products. So, until the regulatory framework for CBD products is set in the US, cannabis companies might struggle to launch the products.In the US, the company plans to do all of the production and distribution for Truss CBD USA in Colorado. Notably, Colorado has an established regulatory framework for CBD use in food and beverages. Therefore, Hexo might not face much of an issue with the FDA to launch its products.In the past, Hexo has disappointed analysts and investors. The company has been missing estimates for the last few quarters. Hexo still hasn\u2019t been able to achieve a positive EBITDA. In the company\u2019s recent results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, it reported an EBITDA loss of 10.3 million Canadian dollars. The company showed 26.5% year-over-year growth in its revenue to 17.0 million Canadian dollars. Hexo\u2019s EBITDA losses were lower than the first quarter. Many analysts also cut the target price for the stock after the second-quarter results.Analysts\u2019 estimate for Hexo doesn\u2019t look too promising for fiscal 2020. After the company\u2019s second-quarter results, analysts lowered the revenue estimates for the fiscal year. Analysts expect the revenue to be around 75 million Canadian dollars for the fiscal year. However, they expect Hexo to report lower losses for the fiscal year than what they expected last month. Hexo could report losses up to 49 million Canadian dollars for the fiscal year.The uncertainty around COVID-19 also doesn\u2019t paint a very hopeful future for the cannabis industry. Many people think that the pandemic could be the end for Hexo. The stock has been dangling at the edge of getting delisted for a while. The partnership with Molson Coors was probably Hexo\u2019s attempt to show investors that things could turn around for the stock. Recently, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) announced a reverse stock split to save itself from delisting.Currently, 17 analysts follow Hexo stock and have a bearish view. Among the analysts, seven recommend a \u201chold,\u201d six recommend a \u201csell,\u201d three recommend a \u201cstrong-sell,\u201d and one recommends a \u201cbuy.\u201d The average target price on Hexo stock is 1.29 Canadian dollars, which represents an upside potential of 86% in the next 12 months.

While it seemed like HEXO had caught a break when it signed the biggest wholesale cannabis supply agreement ever with Quebec, this still did not really help the stock, which is currently trading at $0.47 a share.The company has been going through cash problems and has had to downsize its operations considerably. For instance, it is has halted operations at the Niagara facility, ultimately deciding to sell the facility altogether. The ownership of the facility was passed to HEXO after the company acquired Newstrike Brands.HEOX has turned to issuing extra stock in order to tide over this cash crunch. Recently, it raised C$46 million by offering 60 million shares. The shares also have a warrant each, with an exercise price of C$0.96. Lastly, the company has still not been able to rectify the situation with the New York Stock Exchange, which had warned HEXO about its stock price trading below the required $1.00.Will HEXO be able to turn things around?HEXO stock is in the red today after Stifel analyst W.

The case is ongoing.", "Another perceived-to-be cheap cannabis stock is Quebec-based HEXO (NYSE:HEXO). As of this time last year, HEXO looked set to capitalize on a five-year, 200,000-kilo wholesale supply agreement with its home province, as well as utilize space at its flagship Gatineau facility for the processing and manufacturing of high-margin derivatives. These high-margin products, such as edibles and infused beverages, wound up hitting dispensary shelves in Canada in mid-December.Yet, as of earlier this week, HEXO's share price of $0.535 makes it look like an absolute deal compared to the $8-plus is traded at in late April 2019. But looks can be deceiving.For example, even though HEXO's stock has fallen by more than 90% over the past year, it still sports a market cap of around $185 million. The reason its market cap remains so high is because HEXO, like Aurora, is selling its common stock (or convertible debentures) to raise cash. After ending January 2019 with close to 208 million outstanding shares, the company now has closer to 344 million shares. Considering that HEXO has sold stock at significant discounts to its previous day's closing price on more than one occasion, it's become evident to Wall Street that the company is pretty desperate for cash.\u00a0We're also talking about a company that's gone on the defensive to reduce its expenditures. HEXO has no plans to reopen the idled Niagara grow farm that was acquired via the Newstrike Brands acquisition, and it's also idling about 200,000 square feet of cultivation space at Gatineau. My guess is this reduces its peak annual output from 150,000 kilos to potentially under 100,000 kilos. In addition, HEXO laid off 200 employees last year.Lastly, HEXO's share price makes it a target for delisting from the New York Stock Exchange. It may have to follow Aurora's footsteps and enact a reverse split. Most companies that are pressured into a reverse split to avoid delisting from a major exchange will see their valuations fall even more.", "  HEXO Corp.

But I\u2019m not just talking about owning shares through the recent upturn. This stock should deliver gains for years to come.When it comes to branding, HEXO is several steps ahead of the competition. The company has the second-highest number of patents in the industry, highlighting its differentiation. It was the first producer to launch a premium-branded line of products, labelled Original Stash. It also operates its own food laboratory and research facility with the goal of developing proprietary, value-add products.Most promising is the company\u2019s collaborations with existing brands. For example, this year HEXO is co-launching a THC-infused beverage with Molson Coors. The North American market for cannabis-infused beverages is expected to surpass $1.5 billion by 2026.With a product ready for launch and a respected brand as a partner, HEXO is in the lead to take a large share of this nascent opportunity.If you\u2019re looking to buy high-growth stocks during the market rally, HEXO should top your list.

Then we\u2019ll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we\u2019ll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance.

Third, we\u2019ll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid.  See our latest analysis for HEXO  At the time of writing, our data says that HEXO Corp. has a market cap of CA$248m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of CA$8.8m for the year to July 2019. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at CA$486k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from CA$140m to CA$561m, we found the median CEO total compensation was CA$1.0m.  At the time of writing, our data says that HEXO Corp. has a market cap of CA$248m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of CA$8.8m for the year to July 2019. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at CA$486k.

When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from CA$140m to CA$561m, we found the median CEO total compensation was CA$1.0m.  Next, let\u2019s break down remuneration compositions to understand how the industry and company compare with each other. Talking in terms of the sector, salary represented approximately 88% of total compensation out of all the companies we analysed, while other remuneration made up 12% of the pie. HEXO sets aside a smaller share of compensation for salary, in comparison to the overall industry.  It would therefore appear that HEXO Corp. pays S\u00e9bastien St-Louis more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn\u2019t mean the remuneration is too high. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous. The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at HEXO has changed from year to year.  It would therefore appear that HEXO Corp. pays S\u00e9bastien St-Louis more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn\u2019t mean the remuneration is too high. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous. The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at HEXO has changed from year to year.  Over the last three years HEXO Corp. has shrunk its earnings per share by an average of 71% per year (measured with a line of best fit). It achieved revenue growth of 176% over the last year.  Over the last three years HEXO Corp. has shrunk its earnings per share by an average of 71% per year (measured with a line of best fit). It achieved revenue growth of 176% over the last year.  The reduction in earnings per share, over three years, is arguably concerning. But on the other hand, revenue growth is strong, suggesting a brighter future. These two metric are moving in different directions, so while it\u2019s hard to be confident judging performance, we think the stock is worth watching. Shareholders might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.  With a three year total loss of 52%, HEXO Corp. would certainly have some dissatisfied shareholders. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.  With a three year total loss of 52%, HEXO Corp. would certainly have some dissatisfied shareholders.

Our data suggests that it pays above the median CEO pay within that group.  While we have not been overly impressed by the business performance, the shareholder returns, over three years, have been disappointing. Shareholders may wish to consider further research. Although we don\u2019t think the CEO pay is too high, it is probably more on the generous side of things.

To be honest, I'm sort of shocked that Aurora Cannabis beat HEXO to the punch on the reverse split announcement, especially with HEXO going for a mere $0.50 per share.Like most Canadian licensed producers, HEXO is in a world of hurt. The company wound up expanding production far more than it needed to, and now it's scrambling to raise capital and paring down its operations to match prevailing market conditions. HEXO wound up shedding 200 jobs last year, and has idled about a third of its peak production capacity. The real killer was the admission that its Newstrike Brands deal was unnecessary. This came in the form of a property, plant, equipment, and intangible assets writedown of $138.3 million Canadian, as well as a CA$111.9 million goodwill writedown in its most recent quarter.\u00a0But even with a \"leaner' operation, HEXO is far from being out of the woods. Over the past couple of months, HEXO has sold its common stock to raise capital at levels that were well below the prior day's closing price. This isn't a company that's just trying to stay listed on the NYSE \u2013 it's trying to do everything it can to simply survive, in my view. That makes HEXO a stock you'll want to avoid like the plague for the foreseeable future.One reason the company may be hesitant to do so is the fact that its operating reports have been coming in better-than-expected. Net cannabis revenue soared 65% on a sequential quarterly basis during the third quarter, with total sales nearly doubling and the company reporting CA$5.7 in net income. Such results would not suggest that Aphria is operating from a position of weakness, as is the case with HEXO and Aurora.\u00a0", "NEW YORK, May 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Lawmakers are beginning to take the first steps towards legalizing psychedelics, which are psychoactive substances that alter perception and mood and affect numerous cognitive processes.\u00a0According to a research paper published by Eschelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, psychedelics\u00a0are generally considered physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction.

Their initial investment has sunk by more than 56% after, at one time, being up by almost 600%.At this time last year, HEXO looked as if it'd be one of the more de-risked cannabis stocks. It had a 200,000-kilo-in-aggregate wholesale agreement in place over a five-year period with its home province, and was spending big bucks on readying its processing capabilities to take advantage of derivatives, such as vapes, edibles, and beverages, which were set to launch later in 2019. But little has gone right.Since October, HEXO has permanently shuttered the Niagara grow farm, acquired via the Newstrike Brands buyout, as well as written down a big chunk of that purchase. We've also seen HEXO lay off workers to help lower its operating expenses. But most worrisome, CEO Sebastien St-Louis has said that the company would need 20% market share in Canada just to be profitable.

Aditya Raghunath | May 14, 2020 | More on:  HEXO HEXO Cannabis companies, including Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) have been impacted by a thriving black market, regulatory issues, lower-than-expected demand, high inventory levels, and mounting losses. Hexo shares touched a record high of $11.1 back in April 2019 and have since lost a staggering 94% to currently trade at $0.64.On March 30, Hexo announced its fiscal second quarter of 2020 results. It reported revenue of $17 million, which was 17% higher than its Q1 sales. Comparatively, it reported a net loss of a massive $298 million, which was lower than its Q1 net loss of $364 million. This indicated a loss per share of $1.13 in Q2.In the second quarter, Hexo booked a couple of impairment charges. Hexo stopped production at its Niagara facility. This facility was acquired by Hexo in its Newstrike Brands deal. However, Hexo now wants to sell this facility and reported a goodwill impairment charge of $112 million.Hexo produced 22,305 kg of cannabis product in Q2, up from 16,107 kg in Q1. However, the average selling price per gram fell from $4.35 to $3.49 in this period. These less-than-encouraging metrics did not impress investors and dragged the stock lower soon after its quarterly result.Earlier this week, Aurora Cannabis enacted a reverse stock split to continue trading on the NYSE. According to NYSE\u2019s listing rules, a company\u2019s stock price cannot trade below $1 for more than 30 consecutive trading days. At the time of writing, Hexo was trading at $0.45. It fell below the $1 mark at the end of March and it might soon have to announce a reverse split to maintain trading status on the exchange.Even if Hexo can bring its share price above $1, it is still grappling with structural issues. According to analyst Bill Kirk from MKM Partners, the Canadian market consumes 180,000 kg of pot annually. The total production of Canadian pot companies far exceeds this consumption. One major reason is the slow rollout of retail stores in major Canadian markets.Most cannabis producers, including Hexo, have been impacted by oversupply. However, we know that cannabis-infused edibles were legalized last year and were expected to drive sales in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has hurt sales of cannabis products due to countrywide lockdowns. But the long-term demand looks robust.The North American market for cannabis-infused beverages is expected to be worth over $1.5 billion by 2026. Hexo has partnered with Molson Coors and will soon co-launch a THC-infused beverage in 2020. Hexo has the opportunity to target this high growth space, which might drive top-line growth in the upcoming decade.The cannabis industry is at a nascent stage. However, it is now a crowded space with multiple players trying to gain market share. These oversupply issues might hurt Hexo and peers over the next few quarters.The Motley Fool recommends HEXO. and HEXO.\u00a0Fool contributor Aditya Raghunath has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.", "Hexo is the latest Canadian\u00a0cannabis producer to run afoul of the\u00a0New York Stock Exchange\u2019s continued\u00a0listing standards because of a low stock price.The Ontario-based company was warned by the NYSE last month that\u00a0its shares, which have fallen below $1, do not meet the exchange\u2019s listing standards.Hexo said it\u00a0receiving the notification April 7 before notifying shareholders via a news release\u00a0May 13.As a result, Hexo\u00a0now has until Dec. 16, 2020, to regain compliance.Compliance can be regained if Hexo\u2019s shares achieve a 30-trading-day average closing price of at least $1 per share.If Hexo\u2019s shares do not regain the $1 threshold by then, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures.Hexo joins Alberta-based Aurora Cannabis and\u00a0beleaguered Ontario producer CannTrust on the list of cannabis companies running into trouble with the NYSE.Hexo booked a net loss of 298 million Canadian dollars ($220 million) in its most recent quarter ending Jan. 31.The company\u2019s shares trade as HEXO on the\u00a0New York Stock Exchange\u00a0and\u00a0Toronto Stock Exchange.", "* The second biggest decliner was Hexo Corp, down 9.4%, after the cannabis company received a notification from NYSE saying the company is no longer in compliance with price listing standards.* The second biggest decliner was Hexo Corp, down 9.4%, after the cannabis company received a notification from NYSE saying the company is no longer in compliance with price listing standards.", "  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)"], "sample size": 26, "page count": 10}, "05/15/2020": {"synonyms": "hexo", "pos": 0.08449999999999999, "neg": 0.0075, "neu": 0.90825, "com": 0.5599, "raw text": ["In light of this, many pot stocks rallied in unison with ACB stock.

Just be careful, as not all opportunities are created equal. If you want to maximize your upside while minimizing your risk, stick with cannabis producers like\u00a0Hexo\u00a0(TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO).Why is Hexo the perfect fit for growth investors? It all starts with a differentiated business model.From the start, Hexo\u2019s path to market was unique. Competitors raced to bring large grow operations online, selling their output on the open market. While this brought sales traction, we now know that profits were far from guaranteed. Commoditization forced down selling prices, and these businesses became not much more than farming operations.To avoid commoditization, Hexo focused on building the first cannabis platform. This was a first for pot stocks. Instead of rushing its own cannabis to market, the company prioritized partnerships with pre-existing brands. This year, for example, it aims to launch a co-branded THC beverage with Molson Coors.Hexo realized this far before other pot stocks. The future winners won\u2019t be those with the biggest operations but companies with the most valuable brands. Partnering directly with trusted brands like Molson allows Hexo to jumpstart this process, getting ahead of the competition.In the year to come, Hexo hopes to close additional partnerships in categories like cosmetics, sleep aids, and edibles. It\u2019s a long-term approach, but one that looks very promising as the next phase of cannabis investing arrives.There are several lucrative pot stocks worth buying today, but if you want to expose your portfolio to the rapid growth of branded marijuana, Hexo is the ideal choice.The Motley Fool recommends HEXO. and HEXO.\u00a0Fool contributor Ryan Vanzo has no position in any stocks mentioned.", "Hexo Corp (HEXO) is up 19.8% today, recovering from its crash on Tuesday when it announced they would be raising cash via stock and warrant sale.Hexo Corp (HEXO) is up 19.8% today, recovering from its crash on Tuesday when it announced they would be raising cash via stock and warrant sale.HEXO stock is lower by -90.68% over the last 12 months, and the average rating from Wall Street analysts is a 2.1.

(TSE:HEXO) should definitely note that the Independent Director, Vincent Chiara, recently paid CA$0.90 per share to buy CA$210k worth of the stock. While that\u2019s a very decent purchase to our minds, it was proportionally a bit modest, boosting their holding by just 2.9%.  View our latest analysis for HEXO  In fact, the recent purchase by Independent Director Vincent Chiara was not their only acquisition of HEXO shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of CA$298k worth of shares at a price of CA$2.12 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of CA$0.97. It\u2019s very possible they regret the purchase, but it\u2019s more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it\u2019s very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.  While HEXO insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn\u2019t sell. They paid about CA$1.34 on average. These transactions suggest that insiders have considered the current price attractive. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!  I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. HEXO insiders own about CA$17m worth of shares. That equates to 3.9% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of HEXO we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it\u2019s also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We\u2019ve spotted 4 warning signs for HEXO you should be aware of, and 2 of these can\u2019t be ignored.  Of course HEXO may not be the best stock to buy.

(HEXO.TO) (HEXO) is the first company to come to mind. In March, the stock price broke below $1 and this is a price level that our readers need to be aware of.In order to prevent being delisted, a company can conduct a reverse stock split to raise the stock price while decreasing the number of shares outstanding. This transaction has no impact on the valuation of the company, and we want to discuss why HEXO might be forced to head this route.HEXO has been trading below the $1 level since late March and is nearing the window for a potential delisting. If the stock price does not surge higher in the very near future, we expect the company to receive a letter from the exchange.Another avenue that HEXO might be forced to take could be similar to CannTrust Holdings, which was delisted from the exchange. Due to the issues that CannTrust was dealing with at the time of the delisting, we believe that it did not have the option to complete a reverse split and are of the opinion that it was forced to delist.HEXO started the week on a positive note and reported to have received its Health Canada license amendment for the sale of dried and fresh cannabis, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals and edible cannabis products for its cannabis manufacturing and processing facility in Ontario.Although the market responded positively to the development, HEXO is trading below the $1 level on the US side and this is a level that we are closely monitoring.

However, a reverse stock split often deals a deadly blow to investor confidence due to the fact that most of the time a reverse stock split is initiated due to poor performance. Reducing the share count and raising the price of the stock opens up another dangerous window for short-sellers.\u00a0HEXO does have the option to just let the NYSE delist their stock and move to a smaller exchange. The only downside with that is the fact that smaller exchanges usually attract less capital and have lower liquidity.\u00a0HEXO did have some positive news recently as they received their Health Canada license amendment for the sale of dried and fresh cannabis, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals, and edible cannabis products for its cannabis manufacturing and processing facility in Ontario.Long story short HEXO needs immediate action and execution from management or the company will be forced to do a reverse stock split, or simply just get delisted.

Its strategy is that powerful.The trick, of course, is branding. Coke and Pepsi are world-renowned brands. Pot stocks that emulate this success will win. Hexo is in the driver\u2019s seat.Years ago, Hexo went all-in on branding. Rather than spinning up its own brands, it partnered with existing brands that consumers already know and love. Its joint venture with Molson Coors Beverage Co, for example, will release its first THC-infused beverages this year.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your moderator for today, Jennifer Smith, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start by wishing everybody a safe time and good health and to thank and acknowledge the incredible efforts and dedication of our entire team at Hexo as we navigate through this pandemic caused by COVID-19. The global economy has seen a dramatic reduction in GDP, staggering unemployment numbers. What's encouraging, at least in our industry, is that we've been stable and even more than stable, we're growing. Our team has rallied to meet the challenges as presented and actually exceeded expectations. We've continued to introduce new products and we continue to increase our volumes as we gain market share on our competitors. The company has implemented rigorous safety protocols to mitigate the potential exposure and provide a safer work environment as possible to all our employees. Our team members have demonstrated incredible resolve to ensure we continue to execute at the highest levels and achieve operational excellence. We remain vigilant and we'll continue to proceed with caution.At HEXO, we're determined to be the leaders in adult-use market in Canada and other legal markets where we play. Our philosophy is to go a mile deep instead of a mile wide in each market that we participate in and with each product that we launch. It was this approach that led us to negotiate a significant preferred supplier agreement with the province of Quebec. We wanted to be the dominant player and achieve leading market share. We've done that. We've maintained a market share north of 30% and we continue to provide outstanding service to the suppliers market. And at this point, with the new success we've had operationally, we're poised to expand nationally and to start to provide that same level of service in other markets.There is other examples of how this approach of going narrow and deep has led to successful outcomes for HEXO. We led the way in creating the 28 gram package format and pricing it to compete directly with the illicit market. Our competitors have followed suit, but we've achieved strong market share with Original Stash. We've been selective in our launch of 2.0 products and our hash product has been an overwhelming success. We've established a dominant position with this product category.Very pleased to share that our Belleville facility is now fully licensed, which include the Truss beverage facility. This state-of-the-art facility is highly automated. It's ideally located to serve both largest markets in Canada, and has a national scale. It has the capacity to grow along with our business and our partners. The key effect of this facility is it is shifting HEXO to a true manufacturing company, while keeping our roots in agriculture in Gatineau [Indecipherable].During the latter half of 2019, it became clear that the capital market environment for cannabis companies have changed. Access to capital was going to be much more restricted. HEXO led the way by being one of the first companies to rationalize our operations. This was also significantly impacted with the slow rollout of Canadian retail infrastructure but we adapted very quickly.We were leaders in the following meaningful ways. We provided exceptional service to the province of Quebec. We moved up the ladder in market share and as you know, I have often stated, our goal is to become a top-2 player in adult-use market share in Canada. HEXO has moved quarter-over-quarter from a top-5 spot to now the top-4 spot nationally. We've cultivated new high THC strains that are clearly in the demand from the consumer. We have some new HEXO Plus products in market now achieving 26% THC. We've stabilized and improved our gross margins being ahead of plan by delivering 40% this quarter. This has allowed us to launch and lead the path in the value segment without our margin deteriorating. We've reduced cash operating expenses to achieve our internal targets and we've done all of that in less than 12 months, a big thanks to the team. We've also created products that utilize all the components of our cultivation efforts so that inventory does not grow excessively and consume our cash flow. HEXO was making substantial progress toward the trim problem that we all faced in this industry. Our inventory impairment has been minimized and we'll continue to monitor go forward.We have a lot of work to do at HEXO, but the good news is that our revenues are growing, our yields and volume sold have improved, our gross margin has increased and our costs are coming down. Our adjusted EBITDA loss is under CAD5 million and we hope to be EBITDA positive this year. We've achieved all that while moving up the ladder in market share and taking the top-4 national adult-use share spot.The most significant thing is touching on the market share increase that you're alluding to and what Belleville can -- what Belleville is going to do there, by creating new products. And so with the capacity that we have for Belleville, the single most important impact to HEXO is that it's allowing us to create more 2.0 products, convert more of our trim that's on our balance sheet into sellable product at till sales, which results in more products on the shelf and more diversity for consumers. So we've already started to see that and looking forward to rolling out the full suite of products over the coming quarters.All right. Great and looking forward to see those kind of come out. And just want to -- kind of my second question just continuing on with 2.0 products, and now you do have Belleville rolled out, you've come out with hash, which seems to be off to a great start. How best to think about those additional 2.0 products coming online and kind of impacting the sales line there? And kind of any color you could give in terms of what you're seeing right now in the marketplace from 2.0 products that have come out from some of your peers and competitors and where you think the opportunity is for HEXO to come in, when it comes out with its own products? Thank you.So we're really happy. I mean HEXO for years has been first to market with a lot of product categories. Right? We recently defined with the 28-gram, we're now being first with a hash offering that's national. So we know those things work, so we're doubling down, getting leaner on existing product lines, so that we can keep upping the quality. Our Original Stash product now has better humidity and better THC than we've ever seen in it. And so really happy to be able to continue to offer pricing that beats the black market with a better quality. But now, as well as success of hash, we're trying to look at other categories. So look to us continue to expand on our pre-roll line our vape line, make sure those work well and perhaps even more importantly, celebrating the launch of our beverages with Truss. So we're super excited that we have received the Truss license.Yeah, I think what has been -- and again, I mean I commended OCS on their report. I think more of that will be super useful. I think that gives a great clarity on what's happening in our industry. We continue to grow. Yes, we had a little bit of noise around pantry loading for COVID. I think sales of cannabis just continue to go up. We are in a growth category, there is no doubt in my mind. Yes, we have to keep working through logistical challenges but no sign of slowing down here at HEXO. So quite happy with how we're proceeding.Thanks, Tamy. Yeah so Original Stash's really interesting case study, I think. We launched Original Stash as a black market killer. It was not launched as a value brand. It was really launched as a way for us to offer consumers something legally controlled better quality at the same prices what they already pay. What happened is, from a legal market perspective, the positioning and pricing were just so aggressive. I mean we were 40% better priced than almost all our competitors. So it really forced a shift of the entire legal market down. What I think is going to happen is, you're going to see an ecosystem create around Original Stash with some value products that will come out below Original Stash. And the reason I'm separating the two, the quality of Original Stash is just phenomenal. The humidity control is bang on, the THC percentages are among the highest in the country. And so it's a very, very high quality product. I think there is definitely room for true value plays below that. HEXO is not in a rush for the race to the bottom in terms of, by category, also given that our greenhouse asset is producing such high-quality product.I think we have a lot of opportunity for actually higher-quality product. So you've just launched -- we've just launched HEXO Plus in Quebec. So that's been a quite a success, with 26% THC product. So more care and attention there. So I think the whole market is going to shift down. Original Stash is going to take its place as a mid-market, black market killer with a kind of value bargain basement, call it 10% to 15% THC products below that at a better pricing and I think HEXO still has a ton of opportunity in both growing Original Stash market share and introducing new premium products.On the opex versus COGS question, opex is starting to get very lean for what we want to build. Remember that I'm set out over the next 10 years to build a global top player with HEXO. So that means, I need significant executive bench strength and we have that today. We have a phenomenal team. We've added the full CPG experience, GMs at every site and so those people are critical to the success of the organization. So a little bit of rounding around the edges on opex. But the COGS opportunity and what Belleville is going to deliver is still tremendous. So I'm really not worried about pricing pressure.Thanks, good morning. My question is also around the value segment and competition, more broadly. So with net pricing down around CAD2.25 a gram this quarter. I'm just wondering, do you think this is a floor for HEXO pricing? I know the prior comment, maybe was more around the industry being into a deep value category. But, but do you see kind of like-for-like pricing on HEXO products seeing a floor here or do you think there's more room for that to decline given it does seem that you were early to the category for value, but some competitors seem to be chasing that as well?Yeah, John, let them chase. I invite them to chase. I mean at the end of the day, the consumer will drive pricing and I don't think the consumer has a floor in mind. So as we continue to achieve efficiencies and the whole industry including HEXO is still in its infancy. Now we've done very well. We're one of the lowest cost producers all-in, in the whole country. And you can see that in our gross margin and reflected in our pricing, but if you look at what we shipped in the quarter. I mean over 9 tons of product. If you look at our market share by volume, HEXO is a top player, like, forget top-4 and I won't specify exactly which competitor I'm against but we're right up there as one of the top players.So let the price shocks settle and you will see HEXO emerge, I think, in that top-2 scenario. If we need to continue to use our cost advantage, a lower pricing to ensure we stay in that top-2 spot, we will do so. But I don't think of this thing in terms of our pricing floor because HEXO doesn't need a pricing floor. We still have so much upside on COGS control with our Belleville facility that we will continue to deliver better quality to consumers at better prices for at least in the next few years.Yeah. We learned so much from Molson Coors and the U.S. execs are absolutely phenomenal in approaching a capital-light model. So what's really exciting about what we did in Colorado is we took all the lessons learned from Truss Canada, which had a significant investment, right? You're talking about CAD90 million, up 42% which was HEXO in the balance, which was Molson in Canada to build kind of this world-class asset. But on the HEXO side, we've been innovating, we've been building a patent portfolio on emulsions, etc. We can take all that IP, removing it down to Colorado. The regulatory environment in Colorado allows us to use pre-existing Molson Coors assets for distribution.The other piece is most of the competitors in the country don't have manufacturing assets of the sophistication as what HEXO has at our Belleville facility. So I don't think that the existing 300 licensed producer system is going to continue going the way it does. It's simply impossible for a small-scale producer with no manufacturing capacity to compete with a company like HEXO. So I think that, that will continue to mean meaningful improvement for the consumer.And the third part of that is, as we continue to see yield improvements at our cultivation center, because it's not just from a manufacturing perspective we're making progress, as we continue to put out more product, HEXO also has some opportunities in introducing new brands that are positioned at a better value than Original Stash. So we're really starting to look at that sector as a total growth opportunity, while seeing Original Stash as growth. But, yes, you're entirely right to say that it's what we launched basically define the market. I mean, we had 11 of our competitors follow in the four months to six months after we launched. But you know HEXO is not new to that. The same thing happened when we did Elixir a couple of years ago and I expect that to be the theme for the coming years. But if I'm always six months ahead of everybody, I think that's going to be good for HEXO.Yeah, our beverage portfolio has just had an absolute resounding success because we're taking that portfolio approach basically going to the distributors and saying we have your one-stop beverage solution. Right? You can deal with one or two suppliers, but one of them is going to be HEXO and you can have a complete beverage offering. So that's really resonating as we're touching north of 80% of consumer occasions with our beverages. And so we're not short on orders. So we're very happy to see that full license in Belleville so that we could get going on ready-to-drink. We have a number of fridges and a lot of retailers as well. So we'll be able to offer cold drinks to consumers. So that's all part of the HEXO promise of quality. On the -- sorry, first part of your question again?Andrew, the certainty behind HEXO has never been higher. So your read I think is accurate. We've been focused on reducing variability and go forward and to get to mature as an organization. Right? We're coming off of a seven-year explosive growth start up. And as we put a ton of effort importing top CPG executives in play, HEXO was really matured with it's planning process. And yes, I agree with you, I think that our plan is more realistic than ever and obviously there is still some large caveats like COVID, which is still out there. So we've got to be careful with those types of things and plan very carefully. But we're putting health and safety first, which should mitigate some of that risk, I'm very confident about the future.Everything we're doing is driving to revenue, Andrew, so meaningful step down for sure. We're really taking a philosophy on capex of making sure we get a good return on capital. So any new incremental project, I'm having the team present a full case and I told them, \"don't even bother presenting me something that doesn't have a three-year payback.\" So we're targeting two years or better and that's really setting the foundation for more responsible spend and tying into that narrow and deep philosophy that we have at HEXO.Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to clarify something on sort of the value segment of the market and where HEXO looks to put its efforts in various categories. So, Sebastien, just wondering if you can comment on how this translate your 2.0 offerings. Obviously a lot of new edibles coming to market, vape pens have been around now since January. So as you start ramping up some of these products, how do you view pricing your value segments there?Yeah, I'd invite everybody to think a little bit broader than just value and high-end. I think the most critical piece to understand our Original Stash strategy is black market displacement. So when we think of a CAD4 gram for example in the context of the legal market, that sounds like value. In the context of the illicit market, that's just what people pay. And so for a high-quality gram, that's really the mission of Original Stash. That line extension, you've seen us take that into hash, for example. Now we happen to be the only product in hash today on a national scale, which is quite exciting. But we've priced hash despite the fact we have no legal competitors to speak of, we are delivering value to consumers. We've priced hash at the black market price and that's our philosophy surrounding everything we're going to do under the Original Stash flagship. Now, we'll have some opportunities to do some truly disruptive premium things. So when we come up with 26% THC flower, for example, that was slotting into our HEXO Plus brand because that's simply THC percentages that the black market can't deliver today, at least, from the test we're running.So there is a lot of opportunity still for premium in these products. Again, when you think our ready-to-drink beverages, a lot of opportunities there. But I also want to make sure that in the long term, we're offering consumers beverages that are familiar to them and that are in a segment that's approachable. So you know a few years out, I would love for somebody to be able to pick up a case of Truss powered by HEXO cannabis beverages for CAD1 or CAD2 or CAD10. I think that would be critical. For that to open up, though, we need the distribution to evolve where we can sell case quantity to really deliver that value in the 2.0.No, no, you're right. I mean that's certainly an impediment right now and the regulatory work, I mean, remember that Health Canada has been presented with brand new legislation, first to legalize, first to introduce 2.0, introducing and they're at right at the intersection of food and cannabis. It's very complicated to operate. So I think in that context, we have to give them some leash to understand how to evolve the regulations in the right way. The regulations today are not where they should be. There are still some inconsistencies in terms of concentration. To your point, if you walk into a store, you might be able to buy five ready-to-drink beverages, that doesn't make a lot of sense if we're looking at a risk-based policy. The total amount of THC in those five drinks would be less than what you could buy in an equivalent extract, for example. So there is some harmonizing to do while putting public safety first and I think those avenues are available. I think the industry association, I think HEXO have been pushing for those evolutions and I know Health Canada is working hard on doing it. So, that will come and it will help the market.Okay, thank you. And also you made an interesting comment as well during your prepared remarks regarding HEXO really being a manufacturing type of organization, but not forgetting your roots as being in agriculture. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are for the medium to long term. Should we still think of cultivation as being, obviously, key to really all cannabis companies? And if so, do you think altogether, moving forward, is cultivation something that HEXO would likely rid itself of altogether?Well, so the interesting question and would we get rid of cultivation, I mean, theoretically, if you weren't good at it, yeah, you'd want to jettison that business but HEXO is one of the best in the country, if not the best. So in terms of cultivating, we're phenomenal at it. Like the quality is great, the cost is best-in-class and we keep improving, right? Like, so our THC yield, I've talked about it, but now we're now outputting 26% THC out of the greenhouse, so quite a big kudos to my cultivation team. So in that context, no, I do -- absolutely, I'm not getting rid of cultivation. We're going to keep it because it's a big driver of profitability.I do think you're on the right track, though, in thinking of cannabis companies not as a one-size-fits-all. I think you have cultivation companies, I think you have manufacturing companies, I think you have IP companies and that's why it's so important for HEXO to be top market share leader and that's why we saw it significant to move from number 5 to number 4 and on our way to top-2 is because we are a full service offering licensed producer. We have one of the most robust IP portfolios in the space, as we're invested in innovation. We're one of the lowest cost producers on the cultivation side, and now with the Belleville asset, we're possibly one of three or four companies that have the scale and manufacturing expertise to deliver true manufacturing. So we're playing in all those -- in those three segments. Manufacturing will start to take more and more importance as we go forward.Thank you. That's helpful. And if I can just ask one more question, going back to Original Stash. I'm just curious when you mentioned, Sebastien, you do have a high THC products that will enter the market, or might be in the market now. I'm going to assume, just for this question, that we can call it a premium high THC product, and if so, when you're looking at customer preference -- your consumer preference when it comes to Original Stash being meant to really get rid of illicit market product altogether, when you introduce now a high THC product and also calling it HEXO Plus, I think you mentioned, are there any potential issues with the consumer how they're thinking about Original Stash being a HEXO product versus a HEXO Plus high THC product? And any sort of challenges just for the consumer to kind of integrate with, on the one hand, Original Stash being kind of lower quality type product compared to a higher THC product?Yeah. So, a lot to unpack there. Thanks. The HEXO Plus product has a brand promise of a minimum 20% THC. So we noticed in market that consumers were asking and saying, we don't want these broad THC ranges and sometimes we don't really know what we're getting until we have the package in our hand. So that's why we introduced HEXO Plus. There is not a gram in HEXO Plus that's under 20% and in fact most of them are going to be north of 25%, 26% as I've said. So -- but there is a brand promise there. Now that comes with a premium pricing scheme.Yeah. It's been really interesting to take a look at some of the outdoor grown stuff. First, I don't think anyone's figured out how to do it profitably. Like, if you look at the margin profiles of some of the outdoor growers, their gross margin is half of that of HEXO. So the -- you know until -- so there's some work to do just on the supply chain. That's number one. So it's not ready to go.Once it is ready to go, will it have impact on the flower market? I don't think so. Consumers don't want outdoor product at really at any price. You're also going to have a lot of quality issues with that product. So, no, I don't think it's going to significantly impact the flower market. To your point, how does it come into play with extraction? I think that's something we need to keep a close eye on. Does it displace hemp? And that's why it's so significant for us to be installing massive extraction capacity ourselves at our Belleville facility, truly moving to being a manufacturing company. HEXO is not going to invest in outdoor. We're not taking that risk.But in the case where it's successful, we can become a net buyer of outdoor product, run it through our world-class extraction processes and then feed our 2.0 offerings and for us it will be agnostic. Whether we get those cannabinoids from an outdoor cannabis grower, an outdoor hemp grower or a synthetic -- bio-synthetic producer down the line, what's important to HEXO is being able to manufacture great products, formulating IP protected experiences and having consumer market share.Thanks for that. I think what's important, and I've said this for the last seven years, HEXO is set out long term to build a globally dominant cannabis player. Most companies will require, over the long term, billions of dollars of capital. Now, I think we can safely revise that type of thinking, because we've learned so much and we're learning how to get a lot more capital-light. So years ago, I threw out a number, if you wanted to build a -- one of the top-3 global cannabis companies, it'd cost you CAD6 billion, that's the number I threw out. I think the number is lower than that today because I think we've gotten a lot smarter and how we approach and a lot more capital-light. We've had some international sales now at HEXO that you'll see rollout in the following months. You'll see that show up in our revenue line. We're doing those right from Canada with no assets installed, no employees installed internationally. So we're getting a lot smarter.With that in mind, when you look at the global cannabis opportunity, and let me scale it back to even Canada, the top-3 players in Canada will be splitting a CAD10 billion market here in the country. Now our share, the license producer share of that market is going to be CAD5 billion, right, takeout excise tax, takeout margin. So you've got three players splitting a CAD5 billion market, give CAD1 billion of that market to other small players, right, the non-majors. I'm playing to be a major player. If HEXO is successful, we will have a significant share of a CAD4 billion revenue stream. The dilution needs to be controlled but the bet and making it to that top-3 will make that dilution irrelevant because the success will be resounding for long term holders.Yeah. Well, we haven't toured it yet, but they're all asking, which is super exciting. So we're still -- our conversation is ongoing. Again those are long haul conversations, that's very complex deals. I'm still at the table with major world-class companies and we're still very excited about the potential. We've got now about 400,000 feet of manufacturing space that's in a licensed facility, world-class cannabis Center of Excellence right next to another Fortune 500, right next to Truss, all in the same building, next to HEXO operations that's available to those Fortune 500 partners. So we'll be beginning tours probably sometime in the next couple of months for not only those potential Fortune 500 partners, but also other partners, investors, etc. So looking forward to showcase that facility and, yeah, for sure, I think that's going to have a positive impact in lendings and partners.More HEXO analysis", "HEXO Corp.

Due to the rally higher, HEXO will no longer be forced to conduct a reverse stock split and we find this to be significant. Although we have been cautiously optimistic with the Canadian cannabis producer, the recent trend is hard to ignore and we want to provide an update on the business.During the quarter, HEXO generated more than $30 million of revenue, which represents a 30% increase over the prior period and almost a 100% increase when compared to the same period last year. The revenue growth was primarily the result of a substantial increase in the amount of recreational cannabis that was sold during the quarter.Canada\u2019s cannabis 2.0 market also served as a growth driver for HEXO and we are favorable on this trend. The company\u2019s growth was also supported by the launch and sale of new products (hash and oil extract drops) and this is a revenue stream that we expect to become more significant on a going forward basis.One of the quarterly developments that we find to be significant for HEXO was the 7% increase in gross margins. The increase was the result of decreased production costs through increased efficiencies, automation of packaging activities, and selection of strains which resulted in lower labor costs.In April, HEXO reported a major milestone as it relates to its relationship with Molson Coors and announced the formation of joint venture to explore opportunities for non-alcohol hemp derived CBD beverages in Colorado. This comes after the company was pretty quiet about the relationship with the alcohol conglomerate and we find this opportunity to be significant.Earlier this month, HEXO was granted a license amendment for the sale of dried and fresh cannabis, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals and edible cannabis products. The amendment included the beverage production area that is dedicated to the Molson Coors relationship and are bullish on the leverage to the cannabis beverage vertical in Canada. The license will allow HEXO to achieve greater economies of scale, expand the roll out of 2.0 products, and continue on its national expansion strategy.Going forward, HEXO is well positioned to capitalize on the North American cannabis industry and will monitor how the story continues to evolve. The company recently completed a private placement and we are favorable on the move to strengthen the balance sheet. With a strong balance sheet, HEXO is better positioned to execute on previously announced growth initiatives and we will keep an eye on the opportunity.", "My how the might have fallen.

As with investing in any emerging industry, the ride is likely to be bumpy, but these three are flashing serious warning signs.Canadian cannabis companies have had a particularly hard time because of regulatory issues with Health Canada. The agency's slowness in reviewing and approving licensing applications has hamstrung companies and that problem has been exacerbated because of the pandemic. All three of these pot stocks have lost considerable value in 2020. Year to date, Tilray is down 51.2%, HEXO is down 37.1% and MediPharm is down 57.1%, while The Cannabis ETF (NYSEMKT:THCX), which includes Tilray and MediPharm, is only down 14.4%HEXO, based in Quebec, heard on April 7 that it might be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because the company's shares had fallen below $1 for 30 consecutive days. The company has six months to show it can maintain at least a $1 share price to avoid being delisted. Last week, the company bounced back above $1, but on Thursday, it closed at $0.94.That's not good news, as any company not listed on the NYSE will have access to fewer investors and one of HEXO's prime ways of raising cash is by selling shares.HEXO beat analyst estimates in its third-quarter report, but that's not much of a salve. While gross revenue increased 30% to 30.9 million Canadian dollars from CA$23.8 million in the second quarter, the company lost CA$19.5 million, compared to CA$7.8 million in the same quarter in 2019. \u00a0\u00a0HEXO, which specializes in smoke-free and traditional cannabis products, had a CA$57.5 million share offering last month to raise more cash, but that further weakens earnings per share for investors. HEXO's revenue is growing, but unfortunately, so is its spending. The company faces a real cash crunch in the coming months unless it can get more funding or make considerable cuts. The very real possibility of the company getting delisted is another factor that could drive the stock down.

At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While many described it as surprising, the reality is it was expected, as other larger cannabis producers had a similar growth trend going for it in the reporting period.HEXO (HEXO) recently received a temporary boost in its share price after an increase in revenue for the quarter. While many described it as surprising, the reality is it was expected, as other larger cannabis producers had a similar growth trend going for it in the reporting period.With that behind it, I want to examine in this article why HEXO will struggle to differentiate from its peers, and also whether or not that will make a difference with the success of the company.The major reason HEXO enjoyed a short-term jump in its share price after its latest earnings report was because of the significant increase in net revenue, finished at C$22.1 million, up sequentially from C$17 million.At the end of the quarter the company had C$95.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. HEXO also closed on another $50 million in financing near the end of the quarter.According to CEO Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO has a 30 percent market share in Canada's second-largest market: Quebec. He also asserted the company is positioned to expand nationally.The problem because of the smaller size of HEXO against its larger peers is they will have a larger cash war chest to apply to growth and expansion themselves, which would put further demand on HEXO to raise much more capital as Canada starts to open up and open more cannabis retail outlets.Yes, it has its Original Stash value brand, but the point is its major competitors have all been rolling out their value brands as well, and with larger spending budgets, could not only increase their market leads over HEXO in the provinces it has little share in, and quite probably take share away in the important Ontario and Quebec markets.I believe over the long term, offering a low-cost alternative to customers will help to make a big dent in the illegal pot market in Canada, and that could help HEXO if it is able to grow out its value brand segment.At the end of the quarter HEXO jumped into the number 4 position in the Canadian cannabis market, but not only will it take a lot to move up further in the pecking order, but it's not guaranteed it'll be able to defend itself from competitors beneath it.There is a sense the company is trying to convince investors and shareholders it's on an aggressive growth trajectory, but the reality is it's going to take a long time for HEXO to reach its stated goals and potential, if it achieves them at all.What has yet to be proven by HEXO is if its relatively new Original Stash value brand is here to stay, or is considered a commodity product by the market. In the latter case, if that's how it plays out, then HEXO would have to compete on price, which it isn't positioned well to do against the Canadian industry giants.There are a lot of questions that HEXO needs to answer before it gains the trust of the market again; it'll take time for that to play out. If you want exposure to the cannabis sector, there are a number of better plays to enter into.", "  \t\t\tHEXO \t\t  \t\t$0.692 (-5.31%)During the last month, HEXO Corp.

(HEXO.TO (HEXO) reported a number of significant developments centered on reducing expenses and strengthening its balance sheet. These developments come at a crucial time for the Canadian cannabis producer and we believe that our readers need to be aware of this.2020 has been a challenging year for HEXO and the company could find itself de-listed from the Nasdaq as the shares are trading below the $1 level. If the shares cannot break above this level, HEXO could be forced to conduct a reverse stock split that would result in a higher stock price and fewer shares outstanding. HEXO has recently been trading in a volatile pattern in June and we want to provide an update on the opportunity.On Wednesday, HEXO reported to have completed the previously announced sale of its Niagara facility for approximately $10.25 million. The Canadian cannabis producer expects to use the proceeds to fund additional expansion of its Belleville facility and we will monitor how it is able to execute on this.In March, HEXO announced plans to market the facility for sale following a strategic review of its cultivation assets on account of an excess of capacity in the market. The market did not initially respond well to the planned divesture and only time will tell if the decision was beneficial for the business.Prior to announcing the completion of the sale of the facility, HEXO plunged lower after it announced an at-the-market equity program that allows the company to issue up to C$34,500,000 of common shares. HEXO is working to strengthen its balance sheet and we will monitor how the management team is able to execute on previously announced initiatives.Going forward, we would not be surprised if HEXO was forced to complete a reverse stock split and follow the path of Aurora Cannabis (ACB.TO) (ACB). Aurora was the first large scale Canadian cannabis producer that was forced to conduct a reverse stock split and it appears that HEXO could be following this strategy.", "HEXO Corp.
