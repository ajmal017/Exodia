We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analyst has changed their earnings models, following these results. View our latest analysis for Jiayin Group  View our latest analysis for Jiayin Group After the latest results, the consensus from Jiayin Group's solitary analyst is for revenues of CN\u00a51.67b in 2020, which would reflect a painful 25% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Prior to the latest earnings, the analyst was forecasting revenues of CN\u00a52.34b in 2020, and did not provide an earnings per share estimate. The consensus view seems to have become more pessimistic on Jiayin Group, noting the pretty serious reduction to revenue estimates following last week's results.Intriguingly,the analyst has cut their price target 80% to US$2.40 showing a clear decline in sentiment around Jiayin Group's valuation.Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with the forecast 25% revenue decline a notable change from historical growth of 23% over the last three years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 9.6% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Jiayin Group is expected to lag the wider industry.One Jiayin Group broker/analyst has provided estimates out to 2020, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.One Jiayin Group broker/analyst has provided estimates out to 2020, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.You should always think about risks though.
