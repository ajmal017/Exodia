We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analyst has changed their earnings models, following these results. View our latest analysis for Jiayin Group  View our latest analysis for Jiayin Group After the latest results, the consensus from Jiayin Group's solitary analyst is for revenues of CN\u00a51.67b in 2020, which would reflect a painful 25% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Prior to the latest earnings, the analyst was forecasting revenues of CN\u00a52.34b in 2020, and did not provide an earnings per share estimate. The consensus view seems to have become more pessimistic on Jiayin Group, noting the pretty serious reduction to revenue estimates following last week's results.Intriguingly,the analyst has cut their price target 80% to US$2.40 showing a clear decline in sentiment around Jiayin Group's valuation.Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with the forecast 25% revenue decline a notable change from historical growth of 23% over the last three years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 9.6% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Jiayin Group is expected to lag the wider industry.One Jiayin Group broker/analyst has provided estimates out to 2020, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.One Jiayin Group broker/analyst has provided estimates out to 2020, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.You should always think about risks though.

With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analyst is expecting for next year. See our latest analysis for Jiayin Group  See our latest analysis for Jiayin Group Following the recent earnings report, the consensus from sole analyst covering Jiayin Group is for revenues of CN\u00a51.67b in 2020, implying a perceptible 7.8% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Prior to the latest earnings, the analyst was forecasting revenues of CN\u00a51.67b in 2020, and did not provide an earnings per share estimate. It looks like the latest results have met expectations and confirmed that the business is performing in line with expectations, given there's been no real changes in the new revenue estimates.The average price target rose 67% to US$4.00, with the analyst clearly having become more optimistic about Jiayin Group'sprospects following these results.These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Jiayin Group's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would also point out that the forecast 7.8% revenue decline is better than the historical trend, which saw revenues shrink 31% annually over the past yearOne Jiayin Group broker/analyst has provided estimates out to 2020, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.One Jiayin Group broker/analyst has provided estimates out to 2020, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

The extra options and safety that comes with Jiayin Group\u2019s CN\u00a5140m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.
