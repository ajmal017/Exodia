On July 2 Luckin directors are having a meeting to fire Chairman Lu. (The head of the fraud, this is good news)\n\n3. On July 5 the directors will have a meeting to decide the date of a few other directors. (Further purge bad apples, again this is good news)\n\n4. Once the votes and decisions have been made then a business plan will be out together in partnership with their current advisor company on how to best move forward.\n\n5. My opinion: the bad apples will be removed, the best business plan possible will be put together and executed and financials will be released. Stock will resume trading in OTC and continue to grow and possibly join Nasdaq again in the future. Stock price will still go up in OTC regardless of future Nasdaq listing. \n\n6.
